            <p>
              Hello! Simply put, you are interacting with a serveless ReactJs
              app hosted in an S3 bucket{" "}
              <span role="img" aria-label="boom">
                ðŸ’¥
              </span>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Behind the scenes there's an AWS pipeline that listens to new
              commits to the Master branch, compiles the code and puts it into a
              public S3 bucket.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the frontend, ReactJs is doing the trick with no backend
              required
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also unit tests to make sure everyhting is Honky dory
              everytime anything is changed in the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also made the illustrations. This project was done to play
              with all the above technologies.
            </p>
          </Modal>
        )}
      </main>
