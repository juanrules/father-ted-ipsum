      "Right. \nThat's Tuesday dealt with. \nLet's look at Wednesday now. \nUh Half-seven Mass. \nI can take that. \nAnd, uhmaybe Could you take the eight o'clock at all?? Right, I can take that as well. \nNow, um the half-six evening Mass on Sunday. \nEvening Mass? Too early. \nNo problem, I can take that as well, I'll just make a note. \n- Morning, Ted. \n- Morning, Dougal. \nUh, Dougal?? There's, uh There's some shaving cream just there. \nNo, there's not, Ted. \nYou're grand. \n- No, on you. \n- Oh, where, exactly? - Just there, below your ear. \n- Here? Yes, and there's a bit more - Gone? - No, there's still just a It's all over the place. \nOh, God. \nHow on earth did all that get there? I didn't even shave this morning. \nSo, what are we doing today, Ted? Confessions and things like that? Yes, Dougal, things like that. \nIt's great being a priest, isn't it, Ted? God, it's lovely out. \nOh, wait till I tell you, Ted! Funland's coming to Craggy Island on Saturday. \nOh, yes, the fairground thing. \nI wouldn't have much interest in that type of thing myself. \nThey've got a spider baby. \n- A what? - A spider baby. \nA freak show thing. \nIt's got the body of a spider but it's actually a baby. \nOh. \nHow is it a baby? Does it have a nappy on or something? No. \nDoes it have the head of a baby? Um No. \nWell, if it looks like a spider and it doesn't gurgle or anything, how do you know it's a baby? They keep it in a pram. \nDougal, are you absolutely sure about this? You're not confusing it with a dream or anything? No, honestly, I saw it on the news. \nHonestly! Oh Oh, wait now. \nActually, now that you say it, it was a dream, yeah. \nHave you been studying this like I told you? Oh, I have, Ted. \nSorry. \nBut we should go anyway, Ted, it'll be great! Last year I did horse riding and it was just fantastic. \nI didn't know you rode horses. \nWell, it wasn't a real horse, Ted, like It was this old fellow with a saddle on him. \nGod, he must've been about 80. \nOf course, he couldn't go very fast. \nI was kind of lashing him with the whip and all Couldn't get much of a response. \nAnd how long were you up on him? Oh, I'd say it was about, uh about an hour? So you were up on an 80-year-old man, riding him around and whipping him for 60 minutes? You realise that image will stay with me for the rest of my life? I know, Ted. \nIt's great, isn't it? Come on, we should go. \nNo, I don't think I could take the excitement, to be honest. \nSuppose I'll just see if there's anything on the TV. \n- 'What type of a jumper is that?' - 'Well, basically' Ahh! (Sizzling) Maybe I'll just go and study the old diagram. \n(Phone ) Hello? Father Ted Crilly speaking. \nHello, Father. \nSorry to disturb you. \nMy name is Terry MacNamee. \nI'm producing Faith of Our Fathers for Telly Eireann. \nWe're talking to priests who work in isolated communities. \nWould you be interested? Well, that's very, um That's very exciting. \nFaith of Our Fathers is my favourite programme. \nWell, you were the first person we thought of. \nIf you are interested, I could come over. \nWe'd give you a small fee. \n- Who's that, Ted? - Uh, no one. \n- No one? - 'Hello, Father Crilly?' - No. \n- Must be someone, Ted. \nJust a moment. \nSorry. \nHow exactly do you get to Craggy Island? It doesn't seem to be on any maps. \nNo, it wouldn't be on any maps, now. \nWe're not exactly New York. \nThe best way is from Galway, go slightly north till you see the English boats with the nuclear symbol. \nThey go very close to the island dumping the old glow-in-the-dark. \nAre there any other priests living with you? We don't list anyone else. \nUmwell, uh No, there's no one else here. \nI'll see you on Saturday. \nI'll call when I get there. \nBye. \n(Burps ) The ants are back, Ted. \nNever turn on the TV when Father Jack's asleep. \nYou know how he is! But he's always asleep. \nAnyone who's served the Church as long as he has deserves a rest. \n(Snoring) It's an honour for us to look after him in his old age. \n(Muttering) Look at him, dreaming of past glories, no doubt. \n(Angelic choir) Girls, pay attention. \nWe've got a special treat today. \nFather Hackett has volunteered to take you all for volleyball practice. \nRight, Father. \nHe's just reminded me it's very warm, so no need for your tracksuit tops. \n(Angelic choir) Hello! Father Dougal McGuire here. \nAnd welcome to this week's Top of the Pops. \nIn at number 45 this week is Father Ted Crilly with I've Got the Power. \nAnd at number 15 for the 16th week in a row is Father Jack Hackett, with I'm a Sleepy Priest. \nHow did that gobshite get on the television?! Hello to you all. \nAh, is the television broken again, Father? - Yes, we - There's nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed with a bit of you know what in the head department. \nNow, then, who's for tea? - Me, please, Mrs Doyle. \n- Tea? Feck! - I'm fine, Mrs Doyle. \n- You won't have a cup? No thanks, Mrs Doyle. \nI won't have a cu.\n- You sure? It's hot. \n- No, I'm not in the mood. \nAll right, so Aw, would you not have a drop? - No, thanks. \n- Just a little cup. \n- I'm fine! - I tell you what, Father - Seriously! - I'll pour a cup anyway. \nAnd you can have it if you want. \nNow And what do you say to a cup? Feck off, cup! - He loves his cup of tea. \n- Feck off! There you g.\nFeck off! Father Crilly, I nearly forgot. \n- Earlier, a Terry MacNamee called. \n- Oh, right. \n- Who's that? - Never heard of him. \nSomething to do with the television? He's coming to fix it. \n- He'll be here tomorrow at 12. \n- Grand. \nYeah, it's good you called someone, Ted. \nIt's still not working. \n# You're simply the best # Doo doo doo doo # Better than all the rest, doo doo doo doo # Ahem. \nYou frightened the life out of me. \nYou're doing the old pop star thing. \nI was, Ted, yeah. \nIt was great being on TV today. \nI've caught the telly bug. \nWell Get to bed now and get some sleep, you don't want to get over-tired. \nDid you ever want to get into television? Ah, no, I I wouldn't be interested in that kind of thing, really. \nRight. \nYou wouldn't be much good at it, actually. \nWhat? Why not? Well, you're a bit serious. \nAnd your eyes are a bit crosse.\nThey're a bit wonky. \nThe cameras notice. \nI am not cross-eyed, Dougal. \nAh, you're a bit, now, Ted. \nHalf the time I don't know if you're talking to me or Father Jac.\nDougal, why don't you just get some sleep. \nRight. \nJust have to say the old prayer.\nOur Father, who art in heaven (Ted) Hallowed. \nHallowed be thy (Ted) Name. \nAh, Papa don't preach Dougal, you know you can praise God with sleep. \nCan you, Ted? Yes, it's a way of thanking him for a tiring day. \nGod. \nThere's lots of ways to praise God, isn't there, Ted? Like that time you told me to praise him by just leaving the room. \nThat was a good one, yes. \n- Ted - Mmm? - Ted? - Yes? (Dougal) Knock knock. \n- Who's there? - Father Dougal McGuire. \nGood night, Dougal. \n(Ted, quietly) I can hear you a bit better now, shh, yeah. \nYou made it, then? I think so. \nThere's no indication it is Craggy Island. \nThere's no signs or anything. \nIs there a man looking at you with a T-shirt saying \"I Shot JR\"? Actually, there is. \nAh, you're here, so, yeah. \nWhat? The line is bad, you're a bit muffled. \nI'm on a portable phone, you caught me by surprise. \nI'm on the toilet. \nRight. \nSo, er So where can we meet? Anywhere we can get a few good shots? Any local landmarks? - No. \n- What? There are no landmarks here now. \nNone at all?? No, the island itself is a kind of landmark. \nFor ships and that. \nHead away from it and you're going in the right direction. \n- So, uh - There's the field. \nOh, a field. \nWell, that sounds It's not a field, really, but it has less rocks than most places. \nNever mind. \nI'll meet you at the field. \nHow do I get there? Ask Tom there. \nHe'll help you out. \nRight, Father. \nThanks. \nBird! (Dougal) Ooooo. \nHoly Mary Mother of God! God, Ted, I'm so sorry. \nIt was just a joke. \nTrtry to avoid doing that again, Dougal. \nI thought it was reallyHerself. \n- That's the last thing I need. \n- You're right there, Ted. \nAnyway, it's time for Jack's walk. \nTime for your walk, Father Jack! (Mumbling) Off around the cliffs. \nCan I bring him to Funland, Ted? He'd love that. \nNo, he wouldn't. \nTake him around the cliffs. \nThis time, near the edge, put on the brakes. \nHe was lucky the last time. \nRight, Ted. \nUm, you're not coming yourself? Ah, no, I think I'll stay here and pray for a while. \nOh, ho, what are you after, Ted? I'm not after anything, Dougal. \nIt's not unknown for members of the clergy to pray from time to time. \nHere we are, Father Crilly. \nGet away! There's nothing Father Hackett likes more than some fresh air! - Come on. \n- Oh, yeah. \nThat's it. \n- Yeah, yeah, no - Ahh! (Shouting gibberish) Come on, Father. \n(Confused shouting) Oh, now, come on, Father Hackett. \nThat's it, now, in you go. \nIsn't that better? - Good man. \n- This'll keep you nice and warm. \n(Mrs Doyle ) Are you all right? Ooh. \n(Mumbling) Bye, then! Every single day the same thing. \nOnce he's out, he has a great time. \nHe loves them old cliffs. \n- I'll be off. \nWhat are you up to? - I'll just have a bit of a pray. \nAll right. \nEnjoy the rest of the weekend. \n(PA) 'Patrons are reminded that parking is unavailable. \n'A reminder of the unavailability of parking facilities. \n' I didn't know this bloody thing was on here. \nHello, Father. \nHello, Tom. \nTelly Eireann lads get here all right? They've gone to film a bit of the island first. \n- They'll be back soon. \n- I'll wait in the field. \n- Father! - Yes, Tom? I've killed a man. \nDid you? We'll talk later, I'm doing an interview for television. \n(PA) 'A little boy has been lost. \nThank you. \n' Keep your hands on the sides! (PA) 'The child has now been found, thank you. \n' You fat, smelly cow! Take this. \nYou have a face like a pair of tits. \nWell, at least that's one pair between us! - Hello, Mary. \n- Ah, hello, Father. \n- Hello, John. \n- Pack of Toffos, Father? No, thanks. \nI have to meet someone. \nI'm to be interviewed for television. \n- Oh. \n- Really? That's fantastic. \nYou know, Father, I think you'd be brilliant on television. \nWell, thank you. \nYou'll be more than a match for Gay Byrne or Terry Wogan or any of them. \nIt'll take weeks to get to their level. \nBut I have to go find this film unit. \nThey probably want to do a few close-ups and master shots and that. \nDon't want to be late and get a reputation as a Marilyn Monroe type. \n- See you soon. \n- Good luck, Father Ted. \n- Get them fecking Crunchies out. \n- Feck off. \n(Guitar strumming) (Banjo repeats guitar phrase ) (Banjo imitates guitar) (Duelling Banjos theme ) Ted! Ted! Over here, Ted! Come here and look at me! Hey, Ted! What are you doing here? I thought you weren't interested in this type of thing. \nYou're supposed to be taking Jack for his walk. \nWell, um The cliffs were closed for the day. \nHow could cliffs be closed, Dougal?? OK, no. \nIt wasn't that. \n- They were gone. \n- Ah. \nThe cliffs were gone? How could they just disappear? Erosion. \nCome off and to the cliffs with you! There's just another couple of turns to go. \nWoooo! (PA) 'Patrons are reminded to keep their hands visible at all times 'when not availing on the funfair rides. \n' Go straight home, do you hear? No more nonsense! Everyone else is here. \nDougal, you're a priest, show some decorum. \n- Wish I wasn't a priest. \n- What? - I wish I wasn't a priest. \n- Jack heard you say that! He told me he doesn't believe in God. \nDougal! Ted! Can I have a go on the Crane of Death, Ted? - The what? - The Crane of Death. \nThere was a young fellow killed on it last year. \nLook. \nI'm sick and tired of your Ted, a fortune teller! We'll have one go. \n- Don't waste your money. \n- There might be something in it. \nIt's rubbish. \nHow could anybody believe it? It's no more peculiar than that stuff in seminary, heaven and hell and everlasting life and that. \nYou're not meant to take it seriously. \nYou are so too meant to take it seriously! - Are you? - Yes! - Heaven, hell and everlasting life? - Of course! Look, Dougal, if I let you go in, will you go home after? - I will, I promise, Ted. \n- All right. \n- (Tarot reader) Hello. \n- Let's go, Ted. \n- What's wrong? - I'm scared. \nI'll do it and you can watch. \n- Hello there! - Sit! - First, cross my palm with silver. \n- Silver? - I don't carry bags of it around. \n- Give me a pound. \nNow, I'll interpret one card at a time, please. \nBe careful. \n(Spooky music) UmI wasn't concentrating. \nPerhaps I could pick another? No, this is a common misunderstanding. \nThe Grim Reaper doesn't mean death in a literal sense. \nRather, it may mean the death of an old way of life and the beginning of a new one! I know what that is. \nIt's probably about a new bicycle lamp. \nAnother card, please. \n(Spooky music) Is that good? Well, ah It will all become clear at the next card. \n(Gong) This is really weird. \nThere's only supposed to be one in each pack. \nHello, Tom. \nIs Father Crilly around yet? He is, yeah. \nHe's in there. \nThat's a nasty scar you've got, Tom. \nWhere did you get that? I was, uhin an argument. \n- Oh, I hope you won. \n- I certainly did. \nThat's nothing. \nI've had worse than that. \nCan you believe me own Dad did that to me? It looks like a face! (PA) 'Siobhan to the refreshment tent. \n' Where's Father Jack? It's nearly five, time for his drink. \n- You go that way, I'll go this way. \n- OK. \n(PA) 'Siobhan, please report to reheat the hamburgers. \n' Come, now, Father, we'd better be off. \nCome on. \nFather! Father! There you are, Father. \nWe got here at last. \nFather, Father. \nDead to the world. \nYou don't know what's going on. \nGin! Vodka! It's time for your drink, come on! Ahhh! Are you lads from from the television? - Well, yes. \n- Oh, yes. \n- We'll just ask a few questions. \n- Am I gonna be on the telly? Well, yes. \nWe'll start with a history of the island, then move on to how life has changed for the islanders (Terry ) Father, how would you say religious beliefs on the island have been affected by TV and greater access to the media? God, no, they're talking to Dougal. \n- Think, Ted. \n- Drink! Drink! (Ted screams ) (Angelic choir) There I am! It's me, look! I'm on the telly! 'So, God, does he really exist? I mean, who knows? 'I don't know. \nPersonally, I don't even believe in organised religion. \n' (Ted groans ) I know, it's great, isn't it? 'A spider baby. \n'It's got the body of a spider but the mind of a baby and' (Groaning) 'It wouldn't really bite you, unless it got a bit older. \n' (Groaning) I can't believe it either, I'm on the television! That gobshite again! Is he never off the air! (PA) 'A child has been, eh, lodged in the Tunnel of Goats. \n'If we could have a nurse, please, to the Tunnel of Goats, thank you. \n'A goat and a child have now become lodged together, eh, 'and a nurse has become involved in thein the incident. \n'Another nurse is required to release the nurse we asked for previously. \n'Thank you."

      "Ted, if you had three wishes, what would they be? Three wishes? I don't know, really. \nI suppose the first one'd be world peace, and then maybe an end to hunger and, er (Disco music) . \n. \nmore money for hospitals and that type of thing. \nFair enough, Ted. \nAnd what would your three wishes be? Oh, no, I'm happy enough, really. \n- You wouldn't want anything? - No, I don't think so. \nI can't think of anything, anyway. \nYou wouldn't, say, want a big car to drive around in? Oh-ho, wow! That'd be fantastic! Driving around in a big car - that'd be brilliant! (Panting) What would be your second wish? Oh, that'd be fine. \nThe car'd be fine. \nYou wouldn't like to be a rock star or something, like Elvis? Oh-ho, God, yeah! I'd love to be a rock star like Elvis or something! That'd be brilliant! So, uh, your third wish, if you had one? Oh, no, that'd be fine. \nIf I had a big car and I was Elvis that'd be grand. \nYou wouldn't like, say, um this cup? Oh, God, yeah! I'd love that cup! If I had that cup and I was Elvis in a big car, that'd be fantastic! You've never had much imagination, have you? You're right there, Ted. \n(Helicopter) (Crash) (Clock ticking) No, I'm fine. \nRight. \nUhwould you like me to turn on the television? No, thanks. \nI'm fine. \nRight. \nHave you seen Father Shortall at all recently? No. \nWhat would he be? Would he be 80 now? Suppose so. \nDougal, you wanted a word? Fair enough. \nWon't be a moment, Father. \nWhat's up, Ted? Who's that? - I had to get out of there. \n- Who is it, Ted? - Now, Dougal, don't overreact. \n- Fair enough. \nRight It's Father Stone. \n- Dougal, get up. \n- Oh, Ted, no, not him. \n- It's him, all right. \n- God Almighty! Why didn't you tell him not to come? You promised after the last time! It's like talking to a wall with a moustache. \nOh, God, I hate it! Those awful protracted silences. \nWhy didn't you lie to him?! I did! I told him great big massive lies with feckin' bells hanging off them! It's like asking the Holy Mother to stop appearing to schoolgirls at Ballnspittal. \nOh, God. \n- Keep me company. \n- No! - Dougal! - No! (Ted chuckling) Back again! Oh, sorry! You remember Dougal?? Ah, yes. \nYes, you've been coming how many years? - A few, anyway. \n- Six! Six years. \nEvery summer. \nSowhat time are you going back tomorrow? I might stay. \nWhat? - I say, I might stay. \n- How long? I don't know. \nA few weeks, maybe. \nA few weeks? Sorry about that, Ted. \nFell over. \nTea, Fathers. \nAnyone for a nice cup of? Oh, no, it's Father Stone. \nDo you not have to get back to your parish? No. \nNot for a while, anyway. \n(Chuckles nervously) Right, it's just that there's a problem in that Dougal and I were going to do something. \nW-what was it? - The thing there. \n- Yes, what was the thing? - Yes! - What was it? - Er, the thing, er - Big thing, it was. \n- Oh, er - Oh, er Er Holidays! (Laughs ) We're going on holidays. \nThat's fine. \nI'll mind the place. \nWait! It wasn't holidays, it was something else we were doing that means no one can stay in the house What was it? What was it? Um Wewewere going to - Dougal?? - Have the paintings re-hung! Oh, brilliant! Brilliant memory there. \nHave you noticed? They're all crooked. \n- What type of an angle is that? - It's a mad angle. \nYou can't stay here. \nSee? You couldn't be here when people are shifting paintings around. \nSo, where will you go? - Hotel, probably. \n- That's fine. \nI'll go with you. \nSorry, Paul, I just have to sort something out with Dougal. \nGod God, think, Dougal, think! (Gasping and panting) All right, I'll do the thinking. \nTedJack! Oh, God. \nIf he sees him Christ Almighty, I'll have to break it to him gently. \n- Look, you take Paul out and I'll - You're not leaving me with him. \n- Dougal! - No, Ted, sorry about that. \n- I just can't. \nThere's no way! - Are YOU going to tell Jack? I'll get me coa.\nPaul, Dougal's going for a walk. \nWould you like to join him? - No, I'm fine. \n- Are you sure? It's lovely. \nNo, thanks, no. \nI'm fine. \nDougal wants to show you somethin.\n- It's very important. \n- Is it? Yes, very important. \nMaybe the most important thing you'll ever see. \n- Yeah? - Yes. \n- Right. \n- So you'll go? No, I'm fine, thanks. \nI'll see it again sometime. \nWell, to be honest, it's not Dougal, it's that there's a fire in the house, you have to leave. \n- A fire? - Yes. \nI didn't want to panic you. \nIt's small, but it could spread. \nIf you died, I'd never forgive myself. \nYou go with Dougal, I'll fight the blaze. \n- Right so. \n- You're going? - Well, yeah, if there's a fire. \n- Great! Don't worry about me, drop of water'll do the trick. \nSo, have you seen Father Shortall lately? No. \nI, uhI suppose he must be about 80 now? I suppose so. \nFather Father, are you awake? Father Father, we have a visitor. \nSo, how's everything, then? All right. \n(Jack) Feck off! Bit of a back draught. \nNearly out. \nJack gone to bed, then, Ted? Yes, he was a little tired. \n(Muffled yells) Right. \nWell, I suppose my bath will be ready by now. \n(Sighing) Oh, God. \nCan I help you, Paul?? No, fine. \nI'm, umhaving a bath. \nIt's just that I wanted to go to the toilet. \nOh. \nRight, well, go ahead. \n(Farts ) (Clock ticking) Ah, time for bed! It's only half-seven! Yes, but I have to be up at 11 in the morning. \nDougal, you'd better get some rest, too. \nI can't take much more of this, Ted. \nI know, I know. \nSix years. \nYou'd think that by now he'd have got the message. \nDo you remember that time we pretended to be in Rome? Ha. \nGod, yeah, that was amazing. \nAnyone else would go \"fair enough\" and just not turn up. \nBut five days in the attic! No food, no water. \nRats everywhere If only we'd thought of it this year. \nHow did you meet him in the first place? We were introduced by Father Jim Doogan at a conference. \nDoogan came up and said, \"This is Father Stone,\" and ran out of the building. \nJust ran straight out of the building. \nSo we start to talking. \nWell, I start to talking, you know the way he is. \nTo break the silence, I invited him to stay. \nFor something to say. \nThe next day - the next day! - he arrived on the island. \nGod, if he'd only say something. \nBut he just sits there. \nWhat does he get out of it? I hope he's gone before your birthday party, anyway. \nOhh. \nHe'll be long gone by then. \nWhat is it? Three weeks away? Good God, look at the time. \nI'd better be going, Ted. \n- Oh. \n- Anyone need a lift? (Ted) Dougal (Jack muttering) (Sobbing) Please, God, please! Please get rid of him. \nI don't care how you do it, just please get rid of him. \nDo you want money? Anything you want! Name any charity. \nBut please get rid of him! (Sobbing) Maybe we should go home, Ted. \nThink about who's sitting in the living room. \nOh, yeah. \nIt's clearing up now, anyway. \n(Thunder) - Windmill thing's blown over there. \n- Never mind, just have your go. \n- Golf, yeah? - Oh, God. \nAh, yeah. \nCrazy golf, Paul, not exactly the US Masters. \n- No. \n- Will you have a go, Paul?? - Oh, no. \n- It's great fun, isn't it, Dougal?? - Fantastic! - Have a go. \n- No, no. \n- It's easy now the windmill's gone. \nHere. \nGive it a go, what's the worse thing can happen? Oh, God, Dougal. \nIt's all my fault. \nDon't be silly, Ted. \nSo what did you do, pray for him to be hit by lightning? No, of course not. \nI I asked Him to intervene in some way, but this is a bit much. \nWhat are you thinking of? Who'd have thought being hit by lightning would land you in hospital?? What? What? Of course it can land you in hospital! Well, it's not usually serious, is it, Ted? I was hit by lightning a few times, I never had to go to hospital. \nYes, Dougal, but you're different from most people. \nAll that happened to you was balloons kept sticking to you. \nGod, I hate hospitals. \nEver notice it's usually sick people in hospitals? Ah, yeah. \nOf course, you're a goner when you walk in. \nI'll take my chances in the real world. \nI'd never go under the hammer. \nUnder the knife, Dougal. \nUnder the hammer is auctioneering. \nOh, right, yeah. \nRemember that film where your man's head is transplanted onto a fly and the fly's head is transplanted onto the man? - Oh, yes. \nWhat was that called? - Out of Africa, I think. \nYou know, your man has the head of a fly and he's chasing his wife all over the place, she's trying to hide the jam so as he won't get stuck in it - I have to stop you there. \n- Yes, Ted? No reason, I just have to stop you. \nThere's today's emergency. \nWhat is it today, Doctor? We don't know. \nI think it's a combination of Babycham and Harpic. \nProbably all that was left after the party. \nFather Stone's been in a long time. \nDo you think he's dead? - Probably doing tests. \n- What sort? General knowledge? No. \nWon't get much from him in that condition. \nNo. \nNo, medical tests! So what would he know about that, Ted? (Jack screaming) There he goes. \nHe can move when he wants to. \nStupid bastard! You've really done it this time! You started it, you slag! The next time, I finish the job. \nI Ah, Fathers. \nHello, John. \nHello, Mary. \nAh, hello. \nWell, uh What are you doing here, Father? Uma friend of ours had an accident. \n- Oh! - What happened? That looks nasty. \nI'm sure it's nothing, Father. \nIt's just aheadache. \nI don't know why I bothered coming. \nIs that blood? Oh, God, no, no! I don't think so, uh I just got a slight nick with a knife when Mary was putting the bandage on. \n- It's, uhit's not a stab wound. \n- Sure, he's fine. \nYou've been in the wars yourself, Mary. \nIt's only a sprain, Father, it's nothing! I was lifting a bag of coal. \nIt's not broken. \nIf it is, sure, what the hell??! Well, I hope your friend gets better. \n(Mary ) Next time I'll freaking make sure Shut up, you bitch! They're a lovely couple, John and Mary. \nAh, they are all right. \nOoh! How much longer are they going to be in there? Ted, we hardly even know him. \nDoes he have much of a family? Yes, his parents are alive. \nAndhe has a brother, I think. \nA doctor in America. \nA doctor, wow. \nHard to believe. \nBut that used to be quite common. \nThe favourite son would become a doctor. \nThe idiot brother'd be sent off to the priesthood. \n- Your brother's a doctor, isn't he? - Yes. \n- Ah! Doctor, how's the patient? - Hanging in there. \nMostly shock. \n- That's not serious. \n- It's quite serious. \n- Lightning can do a lot of damage. \n- Can it? Yes. \nHis reactions are very poor at the moment. \nHe's always had very poor reactions. \nThat's normal. \nActually, he's not reacting at all to any stimulus. \nAgain, I wouldn't worry. \nThat's always the way. \nLook, Father, I'm a doctor, and I know it's not normal to fail to react to stimulus. \nI'm sure it is. \nLook, look at this. \nYou see? It's a priest thing. \nWe have our minds on more spiritual matters. \nSo I wouldn't worry about it. \nWell, no, I think I WILL worry about it. \nOh, God, OK. \nCan we see him? I'd like to say a prayer. \nYes, all right, Father. \nThis way. \nAs you can see, we still haven't been able to remove the golf club. \nWhy isn't he in bed? It's hard to get him comfortable when he's in that stance. \nBut you're right. \nHe's been on his feet long enough. \nHe looks like a trophy. \nHe does, a bit. \nSorry, I only just heard. \nPaul! Oh! Come on, Mrs Stone, we've got to get him into bed. \nFather, would you? - You must be Father Crilly. \n- Yes, I am. \nOh, God bless you, Father, God bless you. \n- Ahem. \n- This is my husband, Dermot. \nOh, God, it's terrible, Father, it's terrible! God forgive me for using the Lord's name in vain, but Jesus Christ, isn't it terrible? - It is. \n- Oh, it is, Father. \nIt's terrible, terrible. \nI couldn't have said it better meself. \nTerrible is the word. \nTerrible! I tell you, terrible's too small a word. \nOh, God, Father, it is, it's too small a word. \nLook what you're doing to your mother, you lazy bastard! You're useless! Get up! - Mr Stone - I'm sorry, him causing you trouble. \nGod forgive me for saying this, but it'd have been better if he'd been killed. \nAnd herself all upset. \nJesus, what you must think of him. \nAnd us, for bringing him into the world. \n- Mr Stone - I'm for a drink, will you join me? No, I'll stay here for the moment. \nI'm off, then. \nSee you later, right. \n- And this is Mummy. \n- Hello. \nI know what you're up to! God. \nYou know, Father, Paul thinks the world of you. \nOh, indeed he does. \nHe never stops talking about you. \nFather Ted says this, Father Ted says that - He worships you, Father. \n- Really? He leaves Craggy Island counting the days till he can go back again. \nLiterally! Look! He has a chart. \nAnd he crosses off the days as they pass by. \nAnd right down at the bottom of the chart, a photograph of yourself. \nOh, God. \nAnd he does paintings as well. \nHe did this one for you. \n- (Beeping) - Oh, Lord. \nOh, God! - What is it? - It's his heart! Do something! Oh! Oh! Oh, Dougal, Dou Dou (Beeping stops ) - Dougal! - Mrs Stone, come with me. \n- I need you to fill out some forms. \n- Will he be OK? We're doing all we can, but he is quite ill. \n- Just hope for the best. \n- All right, Doctor. \nCome on, Mummy. \nThe old woman knows it's all my fault. \nHow would she know that? They have ways. \nOld women are closer to God than we'll ever be. \nThey don't need the operator any more, they've got the direct line. \nShe knows, all right. \nWho could blame her for being angry? It's my fault! Why did I do it? Oh, God! Please! Bring him back. \nI never meant you to take him away. \nThere was no need for the lightning. \nYou know I didn't mean that. \nThat was just silly. \nPlease, God. \nBring him back and I swear We'll look after him. \nHe can stay as long as he wants! - Now, Ted - Shut up, Dougal! Please! I swear, I'll look after him for the rest of my days. \nPlease just do this one thing. \nAh, come on. \nPlease! Please, I swear (Fanfare ) Paul! You're back! Oh, Lord, it's a miracle! Doctor! Paul, can I get you anything at all?? No, I'm fine. \n(Clock ticking)"

      "Looks like rain, Ted. \nCome on, Dougal. \nIt's your go. \nI must say, Father Hernandez, it's been wonderful having you over. \nBut I expect you're homesick for Cuba. \n(Speaking Spanish) (Translator) 'Yes, my country is very beautiful. \n' (Speaking Spanish) 'But Ted, you have a great life here on Craggy Island. \n'You have two good friends. \n'Father Dougal 'And, of course, Father Jack. \n' Yes, but I must say, I miss the noise and the lights and the whole buzz of the big city. \n'You were in Wexford, weren't you?' I was, yes. \nBut Craggy Island has its charms. \nThe west part of the island was beautiful. \nUntil it drifted off. \n'Drifted off?' Yes, there was a storm and it just came loose. \nNow we don't have a west side, just north, south and east. \nBut it was lovely. \n'You know, Ted 'Your housekeeper is a very beautiful woman. \n'Sometimes this celibacy is hard for a man. \n'Heh, heh, heh. \n' Yes, well, you have to take the rough with the smooth, I suppose. \n- Bishop Brennan springs to mind. \n- 'Oh, yes?' Yes, Bishop Len Brennan. \nHe's our kind of boss. \nApparently, he was, uh at the old himself. \nThe union was blessed, so they say. \n'No. \n' A son. \nHe lives in America. \nOr so goes the rumour. \nWas it Colonel Mustard in the kitchen withthe candlestick? What? Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the candlestick. \nYou have Colonel Mustard. \nYou showed me earlier. \nHow could it be him if you have him? Oh, right. \nFather Hernandez, your go. \n'Yes. \nI think it was 'The Reverend Green 'with the knife in the drawing room. \n' (Chuckling) Those Protestants. \nUp to no good as usual. \nWhat's Father Jack looking at? What's that you're watching? - What? - Is that a film? - What? - Isn't that Kiefer Sutherland? - What? - Is that Flatliners you're watching? What? 'Is Father Jack a little hard of hearing?' What? Yes, he gets a kind of waxy build-up in his ears. \nThen we have to syringe them. \nIt's not very nice. \nIt's great, because we're never short of candles. \n(Jack) What? All that was in his head last week. \nAnd there's a few more over there. \nWe've nearly enough for a papal funeral. \nHe's a one-man candle factory. \nAren't you, Father Jack? What? To be honest, he can hear well enough when he wants to. \nWatch this. \nFather Jack, would you like a glass of brandy? Yes. \nOh, you see, he's a terrible man. \nBrandy! Brandy! All right, all right. \nNow, say when. \n- What? - Say when. \n- What? - Tell me when to stop pouring. \nOh, right, you want any more? - Yes. \nYes, yes. \n- (Phone ) Hello! Craggy Island parochial house, Father Ted Crilly speaking. \nHello, Bishop Brennan. \nHow are you? Yes. \nNo. \nAh, right. \nGood, yes. \nAll right, of course, yes. \nGoodbye. \nThe boss is coming over. \nHe wants to talk to us about something. \nCome on. \nThis is the longest game of Cluedo I've ever played. \nHow long are we at it now? Five hours? Should there not be some cards in here or something? Dougal. \nTed. \n'Again, I have no words to say how thankful I am. \n' That's a bit ungrateful, Ted. \nDon't you worry, Father Hernandez. \n'However, I do have some gifts from the people of my village. \n'Please, do not laugh at this simple example of Cuban handicraft. \n' It's a video recorder! 'Yes, I'm sorry. \nIt's a very basic model. \n'It has only a three-week pre-record facility. \n' Don't worry about that. \nIt's great! Thanks very much. \nIt's wonderful. \n'And for you, Ted, I have somethingvery special. \n' Oh. \nYou really shouldn't have. \nYou really shouldn't have. \n'It is a Cuban fertility symbol. \n'I hope it brings you as much luck as it brought me. \n'Yes? Eh? Eh, my friend? 'Well' Adios, Ted! (Booming dance music from car) Come on, Dougal, the Bishop will be here soon. \n- Do you remember what I told you? - Huh? It's very simple. \nDon't mention what we talked about last night. \nOh, right, yeah. \nWhat were we talking about last night, Ted? You know, about the Bishop's little mistake. \nOh, right, yeah. \nWhat mistake was that, now, Ted? - His son. \nHis son in America. \n- Oh, yes. \nHe has a son? In America? - Yes, well, so they say. \n- Right. \nThat's news to me, Ted. \nWe were talking about it last night, Dougal. \nTo Father Hernandez. \nWho? Oh, right, the Cuban lad. \nYeah. \nHe gave us a video. \n- The Bishop, remember? - Right, OK. \nJust forget all about it. \nJust do not mention the son. \n- Have you got that? - I have, Ted. \nThe lights are on, but there's nobody home. \nFather Crilly, Bishop Brennan's here. \nHell's bells! Right, show him in. \nNot a word about the son. \nHello, Bishop, how are you? Come on in, sit down. \nSit down there, Your Grace, beside Father Dougal. \nMrs Doyle? Some tea, please. \nOh, certainly, Father Crilly. \nHow's the son? - What?! - The Son of God! How's everything in the world of religion? The world of religion? What the hell are you talking about? Well, you know. \nMrs Doyle, that tea? Here I am. \nHere I am. \nOh, isn't this grand? I'm fine, thank you, Mrs Doyle. \nWill you not have a cup of tea, Bishop Brennan? No, I want to get right to the point and get the hell out of here. \n- Sure you won't have a cup? - I'm certain. \n- Go on, have a cup. \n- No, thank you. \nEverybody else is having a cup. \n- I do not have time. \nNow - You'll feel left out. \nYou'll be Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle. \nI am fine! - Are you sure? Just a drop. \n- No! # Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle! # Just say yes, Your Grace. \nIt's quicker. \n- All right, then, yes. \n- Ah, grand. \nSo, now. \nI hope you're not doing too much damage here. \nJack? Are you behaving yourself? - Feck off. \n- What did you say? Your Grace, what brings you here? Sending us back to our parishes? Fat chance. \nYou're here until I tell you otherwise. \nDo you think I'd let Jack back into a normal parish after the wedding he did in Athalong? - Yes, but surely I'm all right. \n- No, no, no. \nYou are here until all of that money is accounted for. \n- I don't know what happened to it! - Enough! You went to Las Vegas, whilst that poor child was supposed to be in Lourdes. \nAnd as for thiscabbage! The mere idea of letting him back into the real world after the black rock incident. \n- Yes, that was unfortunate. \n- Lives irreparably damaged! They were only nuns. \nNuns are people, too. \nMy God, the strings I pulled to not involve the Vatican. \nI do not want to talk about it! I just want this film business over with. \nFilm? What film? This blasphemous film, The Passion of Saint Tibulus. \nNow, His Holiness has banned it. \nBut a loophole means the bloody thing's showing in this dump. \nOh, yes. \nIs it any good, do you know? I don't care if it's any good or not. \nAll I know is we have to be seen to be making a stand against it. \nI have been brought back from my holiday in California to sort it out. \nAnd that's where you and Larry and Moe come in. \nWhat do you mean? Well, I know that you couldn't organise a nun shoot in a nunnery. \nBut despite that, it's up to you to make the Church's position clear. \nMake a protest at the cinema! Even you can manage that. \nWell, thanks very much. \nListen, this is very serious. \nDon't make a balls of it. \nI'll be in touch. \nYour Grace. \nThis isn't really my area. \nNothing is your area, Crilly. \nYou do not have an area. \nUnless it's a kind of a play area, with sandcastles, buckets and spades! Now, do what you're told, right? Bye, now! Look at this. \nThis is silly. \nThere's nobody here! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a treat in store today for all ye fans of French cinema. \n- Is it subtitled? - Pardon? Is it subtitled or is it dubbed? It's subtitled. \nAh, Jesus. \nShall we start the protesting now? Yes, I suppose so. \nOr maybe we should see a bit of the film first. \nNo, let's just get it over with. \nMaybe it's not too bad, Ted. \nIt could be another Commitments. \nIt doesn't matter, good or bad. \nIt's the morality we don't agree with. \nRight, let's go. \nBoo! Boo! - (Barks ) - Ooh, you bad pup! Who is that? - Dirty, filthy beggar. \n- Boo. \n- Look, you - Boo. \nFather Ted, Father Dougal! 'Tis yourselves! Hello, Michael. \n- How are you? - Oh, I'm grand. \nHow's Father Jack? We haven't seen him since the Sharon Stone season. \nHe's grand. \nA bit tired, so he won't be along today. \nOh, you're making a fierce racket. \nIt's a long story. \nWe have the Bishop over, you know, Len Brennan. \nOh, that gobshite. \nYes, he's gone mad over the film. \nHe told us to kick up a bit of a fuss. \nOh, right. \nOnly one thing, though. \nYou're sort of, uh disrupting the show. \nWe're not, are we? Awfully sorry, Michael. \nOh, no. \nNo trouble at all. \nBut if you could keep it down. \nI mean, we have to think of other people. \n- No problem. \n- Count on us. \nMichael, Michael. \nUm I don't suppose you You could throw us out? - Just for the television. \n- No problem. \nDo you want to go now? Actually, we might as well stay and see the film first. \nSo I'llthrow ye out after the film. \nGrand, grand. \nAnd we're still OK for the, umhalf price? No problem. \nEnjoy the film. \n- Boo! - Now, you! What was all that about? You're asking the wrong person there, Ted. \nI couldn't make head nor tail of it. \nI know for a fact Saint Tibulus wore more clothes than that. \nHe was from Norway or somewhere. \nHe'd have frozen to death! And when Saint Tibulus tried to take that banana off the other lad? That wasn't a banana, Dougal. \nAnyway, let's get some sleep. \n(Dougal) Give us a B, please, Bob Beethoven. \nGive us a C, please, Bob Carnivorous. \n- F, please, Bob. \n- Oh, God. \nNot Blockbusters again! (Dougal) Fettucine. \n(Birds chirping) Another eight hours' sleep. \nYou awake, Ted? - Huh? - This is fantastic, isn't it? - Another great lie-in for the lads. \n- It is. \nDo you know what would be terrible? If Bishop Brennan told us to go to the cinema and protest again. \n(Thunderclap ) This is ridiculous. \nThe flipping place doesn't open for another seven hours. \nNow, didn't the Bishop want us to chain ourselves to the railings? How are we supposed to do that? O'Learys might have something. \nRight, you go get something. \nI'll guard a closed cinema against anyone wanting to watch a film that doesn't start for seven hours. \nJack! What the hell are you up to? Why aren't you at the film? Feck off! What? What did you say? Listen, did you see my bag anywhere, my travelling bag, hm? Well, if you do see it, would you give it back to me? It's got my bloody passport in it, and uh everything. \nRight. \n(Mumbling) ( # Hallelujah Chorus ) Are you gonna stand there all day, you fat old bitch? Don't talk to me like that, you big pile of shite. \nYou ignorant prick! - You watch your mouth! - I'll watch nothing! I'll stick this up your ass! Ah, Father Dougal. \nHello, you two. \n- Father, how's tricks? - We haven't seen you in a while. \nWe were just making tea. \nWill you have a drop? No, thanks, Mrs O'Leary, I'm fine. \nWell, what can we do you for, Father? Well, I was looking for a pair of handcuffs. \nA pair of handcuffs? What do you need them for? Nothing much. \nThey're for me and Ted. \nYou and Father Ted? Yeah. \nWe're just trying something out. \nWell, actually, funny enough, we do have a pair. \nSergeant Thornton left them when he retired. \nRetired from what? From the police. \nThe police? Was Sergeant Thornton a policeman? Umhe was, yes. \nWhy do you think he wore the uniform? I thought he was just having a laugh. \nAnyway, here's the handcuffs. \nOK, thanks, great, great. \nBye, now! Bye, Father! - Down with this sort of thing! - Careful, now. \n- Down with this sort of thing! - Hello, Father Crilly. \n- Hello, Jim. \n- Hello. \nI seen your picture in the paper. \n- What? - Here, have a look! (Ted) Look at you! So it's a blasphemous film, is it? - Oh, it is. \n- What type of thing is it? - Mad stuff. \n- Very immoral. \nYou wouldn't like it. \nIs it a type of nudie thing, Father? You wouldn't believe the amount of nudity in it. \nDo you see the lot, do you, or is it just the top half you see? - Nothing is left to the imagination. \n- Right. \n- Well, I'll be off. \n- Goodbye, Jim! - Hello, Fathers. \n- Hello Mrs Sheridan, Mrs Glynn. \nThe Passion of Saint Tibulus, what's that? - We always go on Tuesdays. \nOh, we saw a great one. \n- The Crying Game. \n- It was brilliant! There was this great bit. \nThere was this girl, then you find out it's really a man! - They got his lad out. \n- What? You only see it for a second but you get the message. \nI didn't know what it was, it's so long since I've seen one. \nIt was like your Billy's! Not at all. \nBilly's is rounder at the top. \nCheerio, Fathers. \nShould we be stopping them going in? Just goes to show, nobody heeds what the Church says. \n- Hello, Pat. \n- Father Crilly. \nHello. \nHow's your wife? I hear she's unwell. \nShe's dead, Father. \nThat's terrible. \nWhen did she? - Ah, just a couple of hours ago. \n- Really? Yes. \nAnyway, that's just the way it is. \n- What's the film like, Father? - What? Is it any good? I was reading about it in the paper. \nYou shouldn't think about the film if your wife just died. \nI might wander in. \nI'll contact you about the funeral details later. \nGood Fathers, I must say, this is extraordinary. \nOur most successful film since Jurassic Park! It's breaking records, due to all this publicity over your protest. \nWe didn't plan it that way. \nOh, my God. \nLook who it is! Thank God, a bit of support. \nFair play to you for turning Come on, Father. \nI'll get you a seat right at the front! Right, Dougal. \nI've had enoug.\nWe're leaving. \nGive me the keys. \nKeys? What's this, then, Your Grace? Why am I looking at a globe of the world? Well, how can I explain? Firstly, a resum of the last few days. \nNow, I don't know if you remember, but I came in here with the idea of you making a dignified protest about this film. \n- Do you remember that? - Yes, yes. \nJust to show the Church's opposition to the film. \nBut - and this is the part that I find most interesting - you've actually made this film the most successful film ever shown here. \n- Isn't that great? - Um I mean, people are coming from all over the country to see the film! They're even coming from Gdansk to see the film. \nAnd look at this! Look! There's you, there's Forrest Gump, and there's Father Jack actually watching the film! Now, there's a turn-up for the books, what? (Laughing) Right! Now I think it's best for ye three to continue your careers as priests-cum-film promoters outside of my jurisdiction. \nHuh? Now, Ted I thought that you might like to go to America, hmm? What part, do you think? Well, umLas Vegas? Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. \nI meant South America. \nThere's a lovely little island off the coast of Surinam and (Laughing) They have a couple of tribes there, you're going to love this. \nAnd they have been knocking the shit out of each other since 1907. \nAnd we've never found the right man to bring them together in the spirit of Christian harmony. \nBut I think that you are the man. \n- Well, thanks - No need to thank me. \nBy the way, do you know how to make arrows? - No. \n- Not to worry. \nIt'll come to you. \nNow, Dougal, over to you. \nIsn't it funny how some of these places in the Philippines can keep going without a proper sewerage system? - Hmm? - You're right, Your Honour. \nNow, Jack, where can we send you? Huh? Jack, wake up. \n- Bishop, I wouldn't do that. \n- You shut up. \nJack! Wake up! Feck off! I've got you now, Jack! I've got you! Oh, my God. \nIf you think this is bad, wait till you see your new parish! Just wait until you see! Well, that's it, then. \nI suppose I suppose all we can do now is pack. \nTed, I don't want to go to the Philippines. \nI can't even spell the Philippines. \nI know it begins with an \"F\" but I know. \nIf only we could persuade the Bishop to change his mind. \nIf only we had something we could bargain with. \nI don't know. \n(Ted) What's that? Did you get a film? The last thing I want to watch is a film. \n'Shut that thing off. \n' # Here I come # Well. \nThat was great, wasn't it? You're right there, Ted. \nShould we phone him now or will we watch it again? I think we'll watch it again."

      "- Ready when you are, Ted. \nYou'll like this. \nOk. \nHere I come! Who are you supposed to be, Ted? What are you doing? You two can't go as Elvis. \nYou Wait a second. \nYou're Elvis as well. \nOf course. \nI've got Elvis written on my back. \nI don't believe this. \nBit of a coincidence. \nGreat minds think alike, I suppose. \nI've been saying for two weeks I was going as Elvis. \nThat's probably where I got the idea. \nGreat. \nThe first All Priests Stars in Their Eyes Lookalike Competition I thought I had a chance in. \nI even made space for the trophy beside the one we got - for the ludo championships. \n- You might win. \nIf you're on before me, I'll look an idiot. \nEveryone'll think I copied you. \nWell, to be fair, it is a bit weird you happened to think of it as well. \nRight. \nI'll just have to go as Mother Teresa again. \nWho are you supposed to be? Elvis. \nI'm Elvis. \n- I'm Elvis. \n- I know you're Elvis, Father. \nWe're all Elvis. \nThat's the problem. \n- Tea, Fathers. \n- Feck off! There's nothing like a cup of tea in the afternoon. \nYou look a bit different, Father. \nHave you had a haircut or something? No. \nI'm Elvis Presley. \nAre you, Father? That's a turn-up for the books anyway. \nIt's for the Lookalike Show. \nNow I see. \nI must say I'm looking forward to that. \n- Is Father kiernan coming? - He won't be, no. \nHe's a great laugh. \nI remember him last year telling his stories. \nHe had me in stitches. \nIt is true what they say about chubby men. \nThey are jollier than the rest of us. \nThey've a way of looking at things. \nHe shot himself. \nDid he? Yeah. \nThat's terrible. \nStill, I suppose that's often the way with fat men. \nThey laugh to hide the tears. \nBut that's life. \nHappy one minute, and the next you go and shoot yourself and that's that. \nAnyway, tea. \n(Phone ) - Hello. \n- Ted, how are you? Dick Byrne here. \nHello, Dick. \nHow are things? - Fine. \nAll set for tomorrow? - The competition? - What have you planned? - Ah. \nI shouldn't say. \n- Mother Teresa. \n- No. \nI think you have a chance this year. \nOh, well. \nDo you really? No! Who was that, Dick? Dougal, I'm asking again, don't go as Elvis. \n- What? - I've been looking forward to this. \nI know all the moves. \n- Remember who's judging. \n- Who? - Henry Sellers. \n- No. \nHe's coming here. \nWow! I told you. \nFather Dunne is bringing him over. \nI've never met a celebrity. \n- You met the Pope. \n- Did I? Don't you remember? When we were in Rome. \nThat was the Pope? That fella living in the art gallery? The Vatican, Dougal. \nI wouldn't say he's a celebrity in the true sense. \nThe Pope is God's representative on Earth. \nYou'd think he'd be taller. \nWhat, like a giant? Still, Henry Sellers coming here. \n(Laughs hysterically) - Henry Sellers coming here. \n- Dougal! Calm down. \nWe've to concentrate on the Elvis problem. \nLook. \nWe'll toss for it. \nWhoever wins can go as Elvis. \nOk. \nAll right. \nRight, heads or tails? Heads. \nNo, tails. \nHeads. \nTails. \nHeads. \nDougal you have to give me a choice between the two. \nSorry about that. \nI got a bit excited. \nHere we go again. \nHeads or tails? - Heads. \n- Are you sure? Absolutely pos Tails! Heads. \nTails. \nHeads! - Dougal. \nCalm down. \n- Heads. \nTails. \nHeads. \nDougal, are you all right? I'm fine. \nI'm just not the best at making decisions. \n- Look - Or am I? Tell you what we'll do. \nYou toss the coin, I'll take heads. \nHeads it is. \nGo ahead, toss it there. \nForget it. \nForget it! Yes! Ted, Henry's on. \nTed. \n'Back to you, Monica for a five-point question. \n'The capital of England - is it New York, 'London 'or Munich?' 'I'll give you a clue. \nYou live there. \n' (Bell) 'Jane, do you know?' 'I leaned on the button by mistake. \n' He's great, isn't he, Ted? Henry. \nAnd he'll be here any second. \nAre you excited, Ted? Henry Sellers. \nLook at him there, asking the questions. \n'. \n. \nstitch in time saves how many?' (Bell) 'Oh, sorry. \n' 'London. \n' Any idea why he left the BBC, Ted? Ah, look, Ted. \nWhy don't you be Elvis? Since you thought of it first, I suppose it's only fair. \nI'll go as Mother Teresa. \nOh, I'm sorry, Dougal. \nI'm being very selfish. \nI'm sorry, you go as Elvis. \nNo, it's not fair on you. \nYou had your heart set on it. \n- Seriously, you go as Elvis. \n- Really? Great! Thanks. \nUnless you'd prefer to go as Mother Teresa. \nAh, no. \nAnyway, there's only one Mother Teresa, and that's you, Ted. \nThanks. \nAt least I'll have the honour of taking care of Mr Sellers. \nIt's important that we be nice to him. \nThat'll improve our chances. \nWe'll fill him with food till it's coming out his ears. \nYou'll be nice to him, won't you, Father? (Groans ) Father, are you all right? Oh, no. \nNot Toilet Duck again. \nYou know what that does to you. \nYou'll be seeing the pink elephants again. \nHow many fingers am I holding up? Three. \nHmm. \nNot too bad. \nProbably getting immune to it by now. \n- (Doorbell) - That'll be Henry. \nGod. \nHe's here. \nHello, there. \nHenry Sellers. \nFather Ted Crilly. \nIt's an honour, Mr And it's lovely to be here, too. \nHello. \nFather Sorry, this is Father Dougal McGuire. \nDougal, say something to Mr Sellers. \nHow old are you? Dougal! Don't ask Mr Sellers how old he is. \nThat's quite all right. \nI'm 37, Father. \nThis is Father Jack Hackett. \nHello, Father. \nHello, Father. \n(Screams ) Bye, Father. \n- He's just gone for his walk. \n- Oh. \nIs there anything we can get you? - Call me Henry. \n- (Jack screaming) If you had something to eat, maybe a sandwich. \nMrs Doyle, some sandwiches. \nRight, Father. \nAhem. \n(Laughs ) - Is something wrong with your head? - Dougal! What? It's just his hair looks a bit - Dougal. \n- I didn't say anything. \nIt's just Henry's hair looks a bit mad. \nIs Is Father Dunne with you? Yes. \nHe's just bringing in There he is. \nHa, ha, ha! Ted! Barty. \nGood to see you. \nSit down there. \n(Laughing) It's good to be on Craggy Island again. \nGod, I haven't seen you in ages. \nI remember the last time I was here. \nWe had that funny incident. \nRemember? I suppose I suppose you've forgotten all about it. \nIt was the type of thing, you know What is this? The last time Father Dunne was here Father Jack lost his slippers. \nIt was a bit like He had us looking everywhere for them. \nIt was a bit like the type of thing, you know - We found them after a while. \n- It was a bit like Oh, Lord. \n- How long was the car journey? - Four hours. \nWith the thing there I suppose it must be! What's it like being a TV star? - Well - It must be It must be It must be We are delighted to have you. \nIs there anything we can get you? No, no. \nI'm fine. \nSome more sandwiches? No, I Ooh! You've brought more in. \nNo, no. \nI'm fin.\nAbsolutely fine. \nThank you. \nEverything Ok with your hair? Dougal! Stop talking about Henry's hair. \nI'm sorry, Henry. \nYour hair is so natural looking, Dougal can't stop talking about it. \nIt really is a beautiful head of hair. \nAnyway, what I was saying was, anything you want, just ask us. \nWe can get it for you. \nThere's no problem there. \nAnything you want that would be at all possible for us to get you, just ask for it. \nAnd I mean anything. \nThere's no problem there. \nAnything. \nI have had trouble getting the English papers. \n- Would it be possible - Except the English papers. \nAnything else, just ask. \nExcept the English papers. \nYou wouldn't have the number of a Father Dick Byrne? It would be a mistake to visit them. \nWhy is that, Father? They're lepers. \nWhat? The three of them are lepers. \nRugged Island is a leper colony. \nLeper colony? You're not serious? No, not leprosy. \nBut there's something wrong. \nDid you never think how strange it was, three priests living alone on an island? I suppose Something's not right there. \nYou're better off with us. \nTed, could you tell me where the old You know, the old The oldis up the stairs and first on the left. \nThank you. \nIt's a wig. \n(Bell) Time for a little nightcap. \nYou're running out of sandwiches. \nI'll bring you in some more. \nI won't have a sherry, thank you. \nDon't be silly. \nOf course you will. \n- No. \nI shouldn't. \n- Go on, it'll help you sleep. \nNo. \nYou go ahead. \nJust a little drop. \nJust a teeny tiny bit. \nThe day a little sherry hurts anyone is the day Ireland doesn't win the Eurovision Song Contest. \n- Go on. \n- No, I shouldn't. \nGo on. \nGo on, go on. \nGo on. \nGo on. \nGo on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on. \nNo. \nSeriously, I Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, GO ON! Oh, what a shower of bastards! Lord, Ted, why did you give him a drink? I didn't know this would happen. \nThat's why they sacked him from that programme. \nHe's a terrible alcoholic. \nHe's been on the wagon for a year. \n- Oh, God, Ted. \n- How was I supposed to know? Sack me? Sack me! I made the BBC! (Sobs ) I made it. \nMaybe if you have a rest you'll feel better. \nGet away from me! Priest! I think it's time we got to bed. \nGood man. \nThere's never anything on. \n- I'll give it a kick myself. \n- You want a fight? I'd love a bit of a scrap but - Bloody priests! - (Laughs ) Bloody sanctimonious scumbags! - Absolutely. \n- Made my life a bloody misery. \nSorry about that. \nAre you sure you wouldn't like to go to bed? Maybe we could stay up a bit longer. \nI'm fed up with you bastards! I'm getting out of here. \nDon't you try and stop me. \nAaaaaaah! It's true what they say though, you should never meet your heroes, you'll only be disappointed. \nImagine we couldn't get him back. \nHe'd be like Big Foot, except he'd be a BBC television presenter. \nDo you see him? There, by the trees. \nGot him. \nThere he is. \n- Terribly sorry about this. \n- No problem. \nI've been through it before. \nActors, television personalities - they go off drink and drugs and come over to places like this. \nThe solitude can get to them. \nWhat happened to this fella? He was fine one minute, then he took a sip of sherry. \nRelapse, that's when they're most dangerous. \nReady? I want you to bang these together and shout. \nThat'll scare him out of the woods so I can get a clear shot. \n- You're shooting him? - Tranquilliser dart. \n- It'll put him to sleep. \n- It seems a bit extreme. \nIt's the best way, Father. \nBelieve me. \nYou know best. \nGod, this reminds me of Vietnam. \n- Were you in Vietnam? - No, no. \nYou know, the films. \nAll right. \nLet's go. \nCome on Henry. \nOut you come. \nThere. \nGot him. \n(Gunshot) It's Jack. \nI've got a clear shot of him, Father. \nDo you want me to get him? No. \nLet him go. \n- He'll make his own way back. \n- Look at him go. \nBeautiful. \nOh, my God. \nMy head. \nThere you are, Henry, a nice cup of tea. \nWhat? Oh, my God. \nWhere am I? What happened last night? I remember having a sip of sherry, but Nothing to worry about. \nI hope I didn't do anything to embarrass you. \n(Giggles ) Dougal! No, you were fine, Henry. \n(Phone ) That'll be Father Byrne. \nI feel sorry for him, marooned with those idiots, and they've nothing in common. \n. \n. \nnothing in common. \nHello. \n- Hello, Dick. \n- Ted, we were talking about you. \n- Really? - Saying you great you were. \n- Really? - No! Hilarious, Dick. \n- Are you going to turn up tonight? - Why wouldn't I? Well, it might be a little embarrassing to come last again. \nWe won't come last, it's you who'll be coming last. \nIn fact, I thought we might have a little bet on tonight. \nPut your money where your mouth is. \nWhat are we talking? A pound? Two? Five pounds. \nFive pounds? What's the matter, Dick? You scared? Of course not. \nFive pounds it is. \nSee you tonight. \nWell, I'd better go and get meself cleaned up for tonight. \nBrush me teeth I've a very strange taste of raw meat in my mouth. \n- I don't know why. \n- Right you are, Henry. \nFive pounds, I must be insane. \nWe haven't a hope in hell. \nWhy can't we all go as Elvis? Because we all look the same. \nAnyway, Jack'll be in any moment for his drink. \n(Glass smashes ) (Jack) Drink! There he goes, bang on time. \nGod, Ted. \nHe looks very rough. \nWe'll have to get him sober before the contest. \nNo, Dougal. \nWait. \nLeave him. \nI have an idea. \n(Discordant guitar) # Ziggy played # Guitar # (Scraping) (Cheering) (Whistling) Fantastic, Father Harry Coyle there. \nYou know, he looks a bit like He won't mind me telling you this now Ah, no. \nAnyway, Henry, marks for Father Coyle. \nVery good. \nI'll give him seven out of ten. \nBastard. \nNot bad at all! Ziggy played guitar. \nThat means the lads from Rugged Island are still in the lead with nine out of ten. \nSo a big hand for Diana Ross and two of the Supremes. \n(Applause ) Don't start celebrating yet. \nRemember we've got one more act to go. \nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome (Laughing) on to the stage the lads (Laughing) Father Ted Crilly with Father McGuire and Father Hackett! (Cheering) (Ted) 'Elvis Presley was a simple truck-driver from America. \n'But one day in the 1950s, he invented rock and roll!' # Dum do bee dum # Dum do do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee dum # Oooooh # Oh oooooh # Dum do bee dum # Dum do bee doo # Do bee doo doo # Thank you very much. \n(Laughter) (Ted) 'Elvis became famous, then they forced him into the army. \n'Then he came out and ten years later came back with the comeback special. \n' ( # Rock and roll) (Ted) 'Elvis was back. \n'From then until his death he played in Las Vegas 'and became once again the king of rock and roll. \n' (Choral music) (Ted) 'Ladies and gentlemen, that was the three ages of Elvis. \n'Thank you. \n' (Cheering) Fantastic! Lord God Almighty! Three Elvises! (Laughs ) Well, Henry, over to you for the final marks. \n(Drum roll) (Cheering) Brilliant, Ted. \nIt was fantastic. \n(Laughs ) Thanks very much, Barty. \n- Five pounds, Ted. \n- Hard luck, Dick. \n- Did we not win? - No, you didn't win, Cyril. \nThis year the trophy goes to Craggy Island. \nYou've every chance of winning next year. \n- Really? - No! Come on, Cyril. \nLet's go home. \nI'm out of fecking whiskey! There's plenty of whiskey at home, Father. \nThat Cyril MacDuff's an awful idiot. \nHere we are now. \nSince I didn't make a fool of meself last time, I might as well have a glass of Champagne, cheers. \nHenry, no! Don't worry, Father. \nIf I can't celebrate tonight, sure when can I? The bastards! What the hell is going on? How dare they do this to me? How dare they sack me? I'm Henry Sellers! I'm Henry Selleeeeeers! - Well, there he goes again. \n- You're right there. \nNever mind. \nWe'll look for him in the morning. \nAnyway, well done. \n- What do you think of the trophy? - It's great. \nAll because of you. \nPut it there, Dougal."

      "I must have read that ten times. \nI love a bit of Oscar Wilde, I suppose. \n- He does it for me. \n- Oh, Wilde. \n\"The only thing worse than being talked about - \"is not being talked about. \n\" Exactly. \nWilde couldn't have put it better himself. \nIt was him who said that, actually, Father. \nYes, yes, but I don' think he'd have said it in that kind of ladylike way. \nYou're a charmer, Father. \nMiss Clarke, I don't suppose you'd sign a copy of the latest? I'd be delighted. \nFather Ted Cri No, just Ted Crilly. \nDon't bother about the Father. \nI envy you really, Father. \nYou must have great peace of mind, being a priest. \nThat's what I'd love. \nA feeling of serenity. \nOh, I have serenity coming out of my ears. \nToo much serenity, really. \nBit of excitement would suit me. \nThanks for the autograph. \nI have to go. \nSome nuns are visiting us so we're busy. \n- Ok, Father. \n- Thank you. \n- Good luck with the book. \n- Bye. \nFeck. \n- Hello, there. \n- Father Curley. \n- Going up? - Thanks. \n(Ted hums ) Well - Good luck again. \n- Thank you, Father. \n- Bye. \n- Goodbye. \nWell, hello again. \nAh, hello. \nWe have to stop meeting like this. \n(High-pitched laugh) Goodbye again. \nGood luck with the book. \n(Mouths ) (Ted) Change. \nPlease change, for God's sake. \nGood luck with the book. \n(Mouths ) Please change. \nPlease! Please change. \nHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord's - Bye. \n- Here we go. \nOh, God Almighty. \nOh, Christ. \nSorry about that. \nAll right, what's going on? - Miss Clarke. \n- What are you doing here? I'm the parish priest here. \nThat's extraordinary! I think someone's trying to keep us together. \n(Laughs ) I've rented a cottage on the island, but it's not ready yet. \nThe builders suggested I stay here for the night. \nIs that Ok? This is amazing! We were both going the same way! Of course, you'd be very welcome to stay the night. \nHello, Father. \nI see you've met your guest. \nMiss Clarke is staying the night. \n- Will you show her the spare room? - What? Will you show her the spare room? Well, yes. \nIt's just that I was going to make some tea. \nYou can do that later. \nI think tea is a bit common for Miss Clarke's tastes. \nAll right, come on. \nHave a shower. \nI mean have a shower if you want. \nI don't want you to have a shower, I mean you might like to get out of your clothes, not that it's my concern. \nMrs Doyle. \nTed. \nWho was that? Dougal, what do you think you're doing? I was hiding. \n- Hiding from who? - From your woman. \nI heard her coming so I hid behind the chair. \nDougal, she's only a woman. \nI don't know very many women, Ted. \nDougal, what about your mother? My mother?! She's hardly what you'd call a woman. \nShe's not like the women on the telly. \nLike the Gladiators. \nShe wouldn't be one of them. \nI'msure that's their loss. \nWhat about Mrs Doyle? She's a woman. \nAh, now. \nCome on. \nShe is. \nShe's every bit as much a woman as one of the Gladiators or the lady who runs Pakistan. \nWhat you mean is, she's not attractive in the conventional sense. \nYou can't think like that any more. \nAnyway, who's that one? She's a novelist. \nI was at her book-signing. \nShe's taken a cottage on the island. \nVery sophisticated lady. \n(Screaming) I'm sorry. \nI just got a bit of a shock. \nCome on now, Father. \nThis is Father Hackett. \nHe gets a bit confused sometimes. \nCome on, Father. \nNo, not your room. \nNot your room. \nNo Arse! Feck! Arse! - Give me the cards quickly. \n- Arse! Feck! - What colour? - Blue, quickly! Arse! F Blue has a great calming effect on him. \nThat's Miss Clarke. \nDougal! - Woman! - Yes, it is a woman, Father. \nRight on the button. \nWell, have a lovely stay, then. \n(Door opens ) Hello, Dougal. \nGood idea, Ted. \nYou're throwing out the ones you couldn't get through. \nNo. \nNo, I was just arranging them in alphabetical order. \n- Fair enough. \n- You're bringing Father Jack out? Yes. \nI suppose so. \nD'you want to come? No, no. \nI'd better stay here and prepare for the nuns. \nFather, it's a beautiful day out. \nMe arse. \nWould you like him on manual or automatic, Father? Automatic. \nIt's a nice day. \n- Might as well take it easy. \n- Take your time. \nFair enough. \n(Gasps in excitement) Well, Father, I never thought we'd have anyone like her staying here. \nHmm? Oh, Miss Clarke. \nIt's very exciting, isn't it? - Famous novelist here. \n- You've never read any of her books. \nActually, I'm a bit of a fan. \nI was at her book-signing the other day. \nI'm surprised, Father. \nI didn't think you'd like that sort of thing. \nI read a bit of one of them once. \nGod I couldn't finish it. \nThe language. \nUnbelievable. \nIt's a bit gritty. \nBut that's the modern world, Mrs Doyle. \nIt's a bit much for me, Father. \n\"Feck this\" and \"feck that\". \nYes, Mrs Doyle. \n\"You big bastard. \n\" Oh, dreadful language. \n\"You big hairy arse. \n\" \"You big fecker. \n\" Fierce stuff! And of course, the F-word, Father. \nThe bad F-word. \nWorse than feck. \nYou know the one I mean. \nYes, I do, Mrs Doyle. \n\"F you. \n\" \"F your effing wife. \n\" I don't know why they have to use language like that. \n\"I'll stick this effing pitchfork up your hole. \n\" That was another one. \nI see what you mean, Mrs Doyle. \n\"Bastard this\" and \"bastard that\". \nYou can't move for the bastards. \nIt's wall-to-wall bastards. \n- Is it Mrs Doyle? - \"You bastard. \n\" \"You fecker. \n\" \"You bollocks! Get your bollocks out of my face. \n\" Yes, you just go and prepare for the nuns. \n(Mrs Doyle ) \"Ride me sideways\" was another one. \nThere we go. \nHah! Miss Clarke! - How did you sleep? - Like a log. \nIt's so peaceful here. \nI need a bit of peace after the year I've had. \nI see. \n(Sighs ) I've had a rough time of it recently, Father. \nMy husband left me for another woman. \nThough it was my fault, I suppose. \nThe sex was getting a little boring and I did nothing to spice it up. \nHa! Isn't that always the way? But nearer the end, I tried a few things. \nI used to dress up in revealing lingerie, and when he came through the door I leapt on top of him and had sex right there in the hall. \nSo, you had a good sleep, then? Yes. \nYes, thank you. \nOh, God. \nI'm sorry, Father. \nI've probably shocked you. \nOh! Go away with you. \nI've heard more shocking things through the years in confession. \nDo you every think about the future? I used to think about the future, and then it became the present, so I thought about it quite often then, and then it was in the past so I didn't think about it that much. \nDo you like Dostoevsky? Oh, him. \nYes. \nHe's one of my favourites. \nI have read that bookten times. \nYou're reading it again. \nYou're on page seven. \nDid you feel his sense of commitment waned towards the end? Yes. \nWhen did you feel that began to happen? Towards the end, you know. \nAfter he'd finished writing about the crime bit and moved on to the punishment. \nI felt it dragged a bit there for me. \nI always thought that if Joyce, k eats and Lawrence were sitting in a room together and Dostoevsky walked in, there'd be a hell of a fight for the last piece of pudding. \nIt's great to talk to somebody about these things. \nMy husband, there was a man who was really afraid of Virginia Woolf. \nWhy, was Was she following him, or something? Oh, Father! You You wouldn't like to come up to the cottage later? For a little drink? Maybe some more book talk. \n- That would be delightflug. \n- Sorry? I'd be delightigetted. \nI'll see you later, then. \nAbout seven? Seven o'clock. \n(Sighs ) Seven, right. \nIt's only a drink. \nSo, you'd no trouble getting here? No. \nI drove the Renault, Sister Margaret took the Mini. \nIt's great having the old car all the same, isn't it? Anyone for more tea? Sister Margaret? - (Meekly) No thank you, Father. \n- Sorry? She's fine, Father. \nAt what time does the Mass tonight start? - Seven o'clock. \n- Grand. \nWe don't want to be late. \n- Seven isn't too Aaaah! - Are you all right? Yes, yes it's There's just Seven o'clock, I may have to leave early. \nDuring the Mass? You couldn't leave during the Mass. \nIt's just, you see Sister Julia says you say a lovely Mass. \nShe said, you said the nicest Mass she ever heard. \nSister Concepta said that last year's Mass here was fabulous. \nTen out of ten, and she's hard to please. \nShe's seen, what Is it 50 Masses since then? Show Father Crilly the photographs. \nYou'll like these, Father. \nThere's you, saying the Mass here last year. \nAnd that's you saying the Mass the year before. \nWhat's that? Oh, yes, your sister-in-law's funeral. \nThat's my personal favourite. \nThat's when you had the beard. \nActually, Father, you couldn't sign a few of them for us, could you? - The photographs? - Yes. \nAll right. \nCould you put on my one, \"to Sister Assumpta\"? Sure. \nOh! Father, Sister Margaret has a question. \nYes? Where d'you get ideas for your sermons? Where do you get your ideas for your sermons? Oh, just overheard conversations, the news, whatever. \nTo be honest, I might not. \n. \n(Shrieks ) Sister Julia, do you have a question? What's your most embarrassing moment saying Mass? Oh, I suppose it was the time I forgot my sister-in-law's name. \nThat got me hot under the collar. \n(All giggling) Anyway Anyway, the thing is, I might not be able to say this evening's Mass. \n(Silence ) - What, Father? - I have something important to do. \nNot more important than saying Mass, Father? It's just, someone I know is dying. \nOh, dear. \nIs it serious? Yes. \nIn this case, the person dying is quite seriously ill. \nIt's someone we know very well. \nNuns! Nuns! Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! Hello Father McGuire. \nFather Crilly was just telling us about your friend, dying. \nWho was that, Ted? Um Er Old Jim. \nAh, is he dying? Poor old Jim. \nHe won't like that. \nHe's terribly down about it. \n- Wait a second. \nJim Halpin? - Yes. \nI was talking to him earlier and he didn't say a thing. \nWell, that's Jim. \nBrave is not the word. \nHe's just outside. \nHold on and I'll get him. \nWhat's he doing outside? He should be in bed. \nI met him earlier. \nHe wanted the lend of some sugar. \nDougal, at a moment like this, this man needs peace. \nDon't - Hello, Jim. \n- Hello, Father. \nHello, Sisters. \nNow Jim, you never told me you were ill. \nWhat? Oh, I had a bit of a cold a few weeks back. \nA cold? Ted said you were dying. \nDying? Oh, no. \nI don't think so, anyway. \nIt's just I was talking to Dr Sinnott. \nHe said He said you might be dying but he wasn't 100% sure himself so don't go off worrying unnecessarily. \n- I'd better give him a call. \n- I wouldn't go calling him, Jim. \nAnd why not? He He can't use the phone. \nHe's gone deaf. \nDr Sinnott's gone deaf? That's terrible. \nIt is. \nOh, wait a second! There he is now. \nDr Sinnott! He heard that all right, Ted. \nDoctor, would you have a moment? Wait, I've just remembered. \nHa! Jim is not dying and Dr Sinnott's not gone deaf. \nI was thinking of two different people. \nSo you will be able to say tonight's Mass? Yes! Yes, I will. \nOf course. \nThanks to Father Dougal for clearing up that misunderstanding. \nTed. \nTed, you're hurting me. \nI have to go straight after this. \n- You'll have to look after the nuns. \n- Fair enough. \n- What'll I do with them? - Whatever you want. \n- Try not to kill them. \n- No chance of that, Ted. \n- Remember Sister Janita? - Oh, yeah. \nThat was a bit too close for comfort all right. \nJust be careful this time. \nOh, God. \nAre they all in there? Yeah. \nLike peas in a pub, Ted. \nPod. \n- Let's go. \nSee you later. \n- Ok. \nGood luck, Ted. \n(Ted mutters ) (Congregation mutters ) (Exchange becomes faster and faster) Right! Please. \nPlease. \nPlease. \nPlease. \n- Pl - (Tyres screech) Sorry about that, Father. \nDidn't see you. \nNo problem, Tom. \nCould you give me a lift? - Thanks again for the lift, Tom. \n- No problem. \nI just have to pop into the post office. \n- It's - I'll be a second. \nI'm meeting someone. \nGod, that's heavy. \n(Tyres screech) Won't be long. \nAnd you, shut up! (Gunshots ) (Alarm ringing) You haven't been up to your old tricks again, Tom? No. \nIt's my money, I just didn't want to fill out the forms. \n(Tyres screech) (Crash) You came! Come in and have a drink, Father Curley. \nI think I might have everything you want in here. \n(Jolly music) Ted! This is great, isn't it? What are you doing here? - What? Well, we were invited. \n- Invited? Same as yo.\nCan't have a house-warming on your own. \nNo, I suppose not. \nVery short Mass tonight, Father. \nWe were all a bit disappointed. \nWeren't we, Sisters? We might not come back next year. \nThey say Father Clippit does a good, long Mass. \nThree hours on a good night since his stroke. \nThat's value for money. \n- You see - I'm sorry, Father. \nI'm in a hurry. \nHow do you get these open? (Pop ) Bye, Sister. \nBye, Sisters. \nNow, Father. \n(Mumbles ) Father, before you go, could I have a word? All right. \nDougal, you go on ahead. \n- I'll be back in a while. \n- Right so. \nWould you like me to put something else on? No, what you're wearing is fine. \nWould you like another drink, Father Curley? Yes. \nIt was nice talking to you today. \nIf you can't talk to a priest, who can you talk to? We're taught how to listen. \nNot that we had listening classes. \nIt's not as if we didn't know how to listen before. \nIt's just being there and somebody talking to you, which is easy unless you're deaf. \nThere's not an awful lot of work involved there. \nNo swotting for those exams with the old listening. \nFather, d'you remember me telling you about reaching a crossroads in my life? Yes, I do. \nWhat do you think I should do? I need advice. \nYou know, Father, that's interesting. \nI think one road leads back to where I was, that's a busy road. \nIt's filled with people and bright lights and traffic. \nThe other road is a quiet, country road with peace and serenity and fulfilment. \n- I see. \n- Which one would you choose? Well, it's That's an easy one. \nYes, I suppose it is obvious. \nBright lights, glamour - I was thinking - Cocaine parties, drugs, Las Vegas. \n- No. \nFather. \nFather. \n- Sorry. \nWhat I was going to say was, I know I've made the right choice. \nI know you havePolly. \nI'm with youall the way. \nI'm going to become a nun. \nOh, feck! Feckfecking marvellous news. \nI was talking to Sister Julia earlier. \nYou know she's 97 years of age? Did you ever think what it would be like to be a 97-year-old nun, Father? No. \nI'll miss Craggy Island. \nIt's silly, I know. \nI've only been here a day. \nBut I'll always remember you. \nIn 20 years' time, when I'm looking in my prayer book, I'll probably still be thinking about Father Ted Curley. \nCrilly. \nWhat? Father Ted Crilly, nice to meet you. \n(Laughter) Oh, no, Dougal. \nNot again. \nSorry, Ted. \nI was just looking for some change. \nOh, well. \nBack to the everyday grind. \n(Jack laughs )"

      "Feck! Arse. \n- These do work. \n- You're right there, Ted. \nFeck! Arse! Feck! (Silence ) (Helicopter) (Crash) (Sighs ) So, you're a nun? Right, Sister Monica. \nI've left your bags in the hall. \nI thought you might like to see the Holy Stone. \n- The what? - The Holy Stone of Clonrichert. \n- Great! - One of the holiest rocks in Europe. \nYou can get souvenir combs. \nThey're fantastic. \nI got one last year. \nThey've written, \"I saw the Holy Stone of Clonrichert. \n\" The Stone is great. \nWe've seen it I think, about 300 times. \nWhy not? It would round off the weekend. \nIf you thought the ludo night was exciting this'll drive you right over the edge. \nIt's all been leading up to the Holy Stone. \nWhat's so holy about it, Father? It's a general holiness. \nFather Dougal stood beside it for ten minutes and got a great sense of serenity. \nYes, I got a great buzz off it. \nWhy is it called the Holy Stone of Clonrichert? I thought Clonrichert was in Fermanagh. \nIt is. \nThe Holy Stone was up there. \nBut it wasn't doing great business. \n- So, treat in store for you. \n- Wonderful. \nThat'll be wonderful. \nI'll just go and freshen up. \nShe'll be putting on make-up, I suppose. \nImpress the lads, huh? Ah, n.\nShe's probably just going to the toilet. \nAren't nuns great? You don't feel as nervous with them as you do with real women. \nYou're right there. \nI just got the courage to talk to her, but it's nice having her around. \nGives the place a bit of glamour. \nA woman's touch. \nAnyway, I'd better go and rouse Jack. \nTell him we're off. \nTed says you were touching him. \nFather Jack, you all right? Ready for another day? I'm off with Sister Monica. \nIf the milkman calls, the money's under the statue of our Lord being embarrassed by the Romans. \nWould you like a cup of tea before I go? Morning, Father. \n(Ted) You won't mind us leaving you alone because Dougal got that new video for you, Reservoir Dogs. \nIt's probably not as violent as the ones you usually like, but sure give it a go. \nWhat are you doing? - This looks bad. \n- What? He's very drunk. \nall night. \nWhere does he hide it? I haven't seen him this bad since he disappeared with Sister Imelda. \nGod, yes. \nThe blue nun. \n- Oh, no, Ted. \nLook at this. \n- Oh, God. \nHold this. \nFather, this is very bad. \nDo you not remember what the Windolene did to you? Father Jack, are you there? - Ted. \n- Imagine the damage polish would do. \n- Ted. \n- What is it? I'm in tremendous pain, Ted. \n- Put it down then. \n- Oh. \nGod, Dougal. \nCome on, get him under the arms. \nCome on, Father. \nWe can't have Sister Monica seeing you like this. \nWhat's the matter? There you are. \nIt's Father Jack's motor. \nTakes a while to start in the morning. \n- He doesn't look well. \n- (Chuckles ) He's grand. \nWe're taking him on a trip to the toilet. \nRight, Father? Would you put him down in that chair and we'll have a look at him. \nHe doesn't like to be fussed over. \nI think you should let me look at him. \nHoly Mother of God, he's dead. \nWhat's the problem there, Sister? Father Jack is dead! There's no pulse and he's stone cold. \nCome on, Father. \nYou're not dead, are you? - He's very definitely dead. \n- The joke's over. \nHe's gone. \nYou should get help and Father Dougal can give the sacraments. \nRight, I'll call Dr Sinnott, but frankly I think you're making a big fuss about nothing. \nThe last rites, Father. \nOh, right. \nYeah, of course. \nShouldn't we wait for Ted? There's no need. \nNo. \nHimself drank it last week. \nYou wouldn't like to do the honours yourself? - What? - No, of course not. \nI suppose I'm wearing the trousers as far as this job goes. \nRight. \nWell, we are gathered here today to join two people Sorry, that's not it. \nWell, Father, best of luck. \nOh, of course. \nThere's more. \nSorry I didn't see you off. \nDon't know if I should be talking to you down here or up ther.\nI'll look up there. \nAnyway, you're there now with our Lord and Stalin and Bob Marley and the rest of them and of course my own parents. \nActually I'd like to take this opportunity to say hello to them. \nHello, Mammy and, er, Daddy. \nHope they're looking after you. \nThe Latin, Father. \nOh, right. \nYeah. \nTotus tuus minimus canus, costa curta Baggio, Roberto - Did you ring the doctor? - Right. \nIt looks bad. \nI called Dr Sinnott, I gave him the symptoms over the phone and he said he's probably dead all right. \nThe pulse not being there is bad enough, but the heart stopping is the real danger sig.\nThat happened to my uncle and he was fine. \nHis heart stopped? For how long? Era wee.\nA week? And he was fine afterwards? Actually, no. \nNow I think of it, he died. \nI think it's absolutely great to see. \nI mean, the level of commitment amongst the African Church. \nYou're bringing the faith to the people. \nIt's marvellous, isn't it? Sure I wouldn't know, I'm from Donegal. \nWill you have a sandwich, Father Cleary? - No, thanks, Mrs Doyle. \nI'm fine. \n- Have a try. \nThey're diagonal. \nSo I see. \nBut no thanks, anyway. \nGo on. \nThey're only small. \n- I'm fine. \n- Are you sure you won't have one? No thanks. \nI ate before I came out. \n- I could put one in a bag for later. \n- No, don't bother. \nHere's a little bag you can bring one home in. \n- No, no. \n- Here's a bigger bag - to put the little bag in. \n- No. \nYou can eat it later or now. \nWhatever suits. \nOh You'll have one now. \nSure, I might as well. \nMrs Doyle. \nFather Mackey would like a sandwich. \nFather Mackey, will you have a sandwich? I'm terribly sorry I'm late, Ted. \nThe car. \nThe car broke down. \nThat's all right. \nFather Fay, how are you? (Mumbles ) He is. \nIt was very quick. \n(Gibberish) Yes, I suppose so. \nOooo Ee-ur? In New Zealand and a sister in South Africa. \nWhy him, Ted? Why is it always the good ones? You bastard! Father! He could've been Pope, Ted. \nBut the fecking Jesuits, they have it all tied up. \n- Yes. \n- Imagine, Ted. \nA Polish Pope. \nIt should've been Jack! But it's not what you know, is it? It's who you know. \nIt's sad, but look at him. \nHe looks serene. \n(Wails) Oh, God! No, no, no! No! He's dead, Ted. \nWe'll never see him again. \n(Sobs ) - We'll see him in the next world. \n- Oh, yeah, sure. \n(Shouting) Oh, God. \nNo. \nGet him down. \nGet him down. \nGet him down. \n(Shouting) Feck off. \nGimme lots of drink. \nArse! Feck! Drink! Feck off. \nTed, you big fool. \nWhat are you doing? You shouldn't be getting up to this nonsense. \nUp you get. \nWe should leave his chair idle for a while. \nWould you look at that. \nCompletely bald. \nSmooth as a baby's behind. \nYou'd know about that. \n- What? - You know, when you baptise them. \nOh. \nNow, I'm going to give Sister Monica a lift. \n- Down to the boat. \n- Thank you, Father. \nIt's the least we could do. \nYou were always very good to Father Jac.\nExcuse me, Father Crilly, there's a woman here to see you. \nA woman, Mrs Doyle. \nI think you mean a nun. \nOh, no, no, no, no. \nIt's a woman all right. \nA young womanwith a skirt. \nI'll be off then. \n- Hello, Father Crilly? - Yes. \nI'm from Corless, Corless and Sweeney. \nWe're fine for coal, thanks. \nNo. \nIt's nothing to do with coal. \nMy name is Laura Sweeney. \nThis must be Father McGuire. \nI think you both better sit down. \nI've got a shock for you. \nI want to assure you that was a routine relocation of funds. \nNo, no. \nThe money was resting in my account before You don't understand. \nThis is about Father Hackett. \nPlease, sit down and I'll explain everything. \nIt may come as a surprise for you that Father Hackett left a will. \nDid he? What does it say? Well, if I may \"I, Father Jack Hackett, being of sound mind and body\" Sorry. \n\". \n. \nleave my entire fortune to Father Ted Crilly and Father Dougal McGuire \"to be distributed equally amongst them and\" I'll be off now, then, Father. \nI'll make the way to the boat myself, then. \nYeah, yeah. \n- Bye, Fathers. \n- Yeah, bye. \nListen, Dougal. \nFather Jack left us money. \nThat's very nice of him. \nHow much? Ha Half Half a million pounds. \nHalf a million pounds each! No, between us. \nIt's only a quarter of a million each, Ted. \nTed. \nTed? That's that. \nIt looks like you're going to be very rich men. \nGrand. \nThere's one requirement, which I'm surprised you didn't discuss. \n- Oh? - When is the funeral again? Again? We haven't had the first one yet, so No. \nSorry, maybe I didn't make myself clear. \n- It's tomorrow morning. \n- Right. \nYou know about Father Hackett's fear of being buried alive. \nThere's no chance of that now. \nYou know He's dead. \nOh, yes. \nThat's why he wouldn't do confession. \nHe didn't like enclosed spaces. \nBut he also just didn't want to do it. \nStrangers telling you their sins. \nWho'd be bothered with that? Well, Father Hackett's fear was so great, he stipulated that you two must spend the night before the burial with him. \nOk. \nThat's the least we can do. \nWe can discuss it with the solicitor. \nNo, I am the solicitor. \n(Sniggers ) No, you're not. \nI'm sorry, I am a senior partner in Corless, Corless and Sweeney. \nNow, come on, now. \nJust because we're from the island, you think you can have fun with us. \nI assure you All right. \nThe big thickos from the island. \n- But we're not as thick as we look. \n- No way, Jose. \nWait a second! Why do you think I've been talking to you all this time? Look, you're a lovely girl, but I think we should talk to the solicitor. \nIf you're a solicitor, I'm Boy George. \n# karma karma karma karma karma Chameleon # You come and go # You come and go # karma karma karma karma Chameleon # (Ted sighs ) - How's your head, Ted? - Not too bad. \nIt's true what they say about career women. \nVery aggressive. \n- She was very aggressive. \n- The language! You wouldn't hear it from a docker. \nYou would. \nThey use very bad language. \n\"Effing this\" and \"Effing that\". \nIt was worse. \nShe was saying fu Now, Dougal! Who'd have thought Father Jack had half a million pounds? He never said a word about it. \nLying in a bank account all these years. \nHow did he get it in the first place? As far as I understand, he was just an astute saver. \nTried to avoid giving money to charity, he wouldn't wear trousers during summer, that saved a couple of bob in wear and tear. \nAll sorts of savings all over the place. \nIt all adds up. \nI suppose we only knew him in his twilight years. \nBut I think we saw the best of him. \nThe really lovely man. \nTrue knight of the Church. \nGentle, lovely sense of humour. \nPatient, good-natured. \nSorry, Ted. \nWho's this now? Who do you think I'd be talking about at this moment? I'm not sure. \nI didn't catch the start. \nJack, of course. \nOh, right. \nYes. \nA great priest. \nFirst priest to denounce The Beatles. \n- Right. \n- He could see what they were up to. \nHe loved children, of course. \nHe did, yes. \nThey were terrified of him, though. \nHe had that stick and he'd be waving it. \nMaybe they thought he'd hit them. \nI heard that when he was teaching he was a great believer in discipline. \n(Muttering) Would you say he was a good teacher? Friend of mine, Father Jimmy Rannable, studied under him. \nHe told me once, no one, no one had such a huge effect on him as Father Jack. \nJimmy Rannable. \nWhat happened to him? - Remember the Drumshanbo Massacre? - Yeah. \n- That was him. \n- Oh. \nAnother thing about Jack, he loved a bit of competition. \nHe'd a great sense of fair play. \n(Angelic choir) A great traditionalist. \nHe didn't agree with the modern thinking within the Church. \nYou'll burn for all eternity in hell! Hell! Funny, one moment you're here, the next moment \"And in the happy no-time of his sleeping \"Death took him by the heart. \n\" You know, someone once said that life is but a thin sliver of light between two immensities of darkness. \nMakes you think. \nDoes, Ted. \nAbout what? About death, Dougal. \nAbout death. \nThat's very morbid. \nWhat started you off thinking about death? Still, it's good we have this time with him. \nMaybe sometimes we weren't always as thoughtful as we could have been. \nAt least now we're able to have this time with him. \nTreat him with the respect he deserves. \nYou're right there, Ted. \nD'you fancy now a game of charades? - Yes, I think so! - Right so, you go first. \nRight. \nI'll start. \nI'll give you an easy one. \nFishing! Gone fishing. \nBoxing One-handed boxing. \n- It's a film. \n- You're not supposed to tell me. \nOk. \nFilm. \n- One film. \n- One word. \nCome on, Ted. \nYou're making it a bit too easy for me. \nI'm not an idiot, you know. \nOne-word film. \nCan't be too many of them. \nSalem's Lot. \nTongue. \nMouth! Teeth! Is there a film called Tongue? Tom Tongue. \nEr Tongue Fish. \nS-s-s-swim tongue. \nEr Fish! Attack of the giant killing fish. \nTongue Fish. \nThe Deep. \nPiranha. \nJaws 2. \nClose, then. \nGhostbusters 2! Superman 2! No. \nBatman Returns. \nYou had it, it was Jaws! No, I had Jaws 2. \nIt's different. \nIt's very different. \nIt's a different shark. \nTed, are you still awake? - Yes, yes. \n- Just wanted to ask you a question. \nNot again, Dougal. \nLook, when a man and a lady are very much in love No! No, I didn't want to ask that, Ted. \nI wanted to ask you, do you believe in an afterlife? - Do I what? - Do you believe in an afterlife? Dougal, generally speaking, priests tend to have a strong belief in the afterlife. \nI wish I had your faith, Ted. \n(Sighs ) Dougal, how did you get into the Church? Was it \"collect twelve crisp packets and become a priest\"? Ted? Dougal, please let me go to sleep. \nI was wondering, what are you gonna do with your share of the money? Well Luckily, there are lots of charity organisations that are grateful for money. \nThere's Concern, St Vincent de Paul, Food for Africa, Help the Aged. \n(Disco music) Maybe a few pounds for Comic Relief. \nSo, some good will come from Father Jack's death. \nIt's hard to believe he's gone, though, isn't it? You're right there. \n(Snoring) It's beginning to snow again. \nThe flakes, silver and dark, are falling obliquely against the lamplight. \nIt's probably snowing all over the island, on the central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the graveyards, upon the crosses and the headstones, upon all the living and the dead. \nShut the feck up! Ted! What's wrong? Father Jack, did you see what happened? Ted? What happened, Father Jack? Wha Ooooo! (Snores ) So, there he is, risen from the dead, like that fella ET. \nThere's one thing that confuses me. \n- Yes? - Is Jack dead or what? Apparently not. \nThe floor polish brought about all the symptoms of death, such as no heartbeat, rigor mortis, decomposition, but he was lucky, the effects just wore off him. \nIt's good to have him back, isn't it? Mmm. \nWho needs half a million pounds, anyway? Yes, our life is the spiritual life. \n(Disco music) But to be honest I don't like talking about this, but it's only a matter of time. \nI mean, he's not a young man. \nAnd, you know, I suppose, when he's gone it won't be so bad. \nThe money will be some comfort to us. \nThat's something. \nNow, you'd better come to the shops. \nI want to buy some more floor polish. \nMaybe we should get a few different brands, just to try them out, like. \nYes, we could leave them all round the house. \nOr we could leave them in Jack's room and ask him to keep an eye on them. \nDrink! Feck off! (Disco music)"

      "Now, Tom, this is the first time you've been trusted with such a large consignment of raw sewage. \n- Are you sure you'll be all right? - Don't worry about me at all. \nThis button opens the doors and this one shoots the sewage out. \n(Tom ) This for the doors and this shoots the stuff out? - No, the other way around. \n- Right you are! Good luck, so. \nJuly the 19th. \nWhy does that strike me as important? Yes! July 19th? I wouldn't know, Ted, you big bollocks. \nI'm sorry? I said I wouldn't know, Ted, you big bollocks. \nHave you been reading those Roddy Doyle books again, Dougal? I have, yeah, Ted, you big gobshite. \nThat's all very well. \nBut remember, they're just stories. \nNormal people like us don't use that language. \n- This is the real world. \n- Oh, you're right there, Ted. \nAnyway, any idea why July the 19th should be so important? Would that be the day the Ice Age ended? No, Dougal! They can't be that precise about the Ice Age. \nI'll look it up in the diary. \nJuly 19th. \n\"On this day, Galway liberated from Indians \"Marathon becomes Snickers\" A-ha, Ted! \"Ice Age ends. \n\" Time for tea, Fathers. \nMrs Doyle, is anything important about July the 19th? It doesn't matter what day it is, Father, there's always time for a nice cup of tea. \nDidn't our Lord Himself on the cross pause for a nice cup of tea before giving Himself up for the world? No, He didn't, Mrs Doyle! Whatever equivalent they had for tea in those days - cake or whatever. \nAnd speaking of cake I have cake. \nI'm fine for cake, Mrs Doyle. \nAre you sure, Father? There's cocaine in it. \nThere's what?! Oh, no, not cocaine. \nWhat am I on about? No, I meant What do you call them? Raisins. \nRight. \nI won't, thanks. \nAh, you will. \nSure, it's only small. \nIt's just a tiny little cake. \nYou won't feel it. \nYou won't even know you're eatin' it. \nNo, I will know I'm eating it, Mrs Doyle. \nNo, you won't! Look at the size of it! It's hardly even a cake. \nIt's a micro-cake. \n- No, Mrs Doyle, I really won't - Aw, come on now. \nIt's got raisins cherriescinnamon! - Cinnamon? - Oh, yes. \nI do love cinnamon. \nWhat the heck, I'll have one. \nGreat! No. \nNo, Father, I'm forcing you. \nNo, you're not. \nReally! - I love cinnamon. \n- No, no, you're just being polite. \nIf you don't want any, all you have to do is say \"no\". \nJust that one little word, \"no\". \nIt's a lovely word our Lord gave us to use when we don't want any cake. \nYes, but just this once, I'd actually love some cake. \nWell, you can't have any! I want cake! No, I'm just going out to have these destroyed. \nSorry about that, Father. \nAnyway, this date thing is bothering me now. \nJuly the 19th. \nIs there something we always do on July 19th? - (Crashing) - (Jack) Drink! - Is it something to do with Jack? - Maybe it's - Oh, God, it's not his bath?! - Oh, no, it couldn't be! No, wait! Calm down! He's just had his bath! Remember? Just before Christmas. \nOh, thank God for that! God Almighty! - You Ok? - I think so. \nSo what could it be? A-ha! Holiday. \n(Ted) Come on, Dougal. \nBetter get moving. \nWhere'll be go on holiday, Ted? - God, I don't know. \n- Pearson's? Mr Pearson doesn't like people staying. \nIt's not a guesthouse. \n- Is it not? - No, no. \nRemember the argument last year when we tried to stay the second week? Wait! Father O'Rourke's caravan! He said we could use it anytime. \nOh, no, Ted, not again! It's very small. \nNo, he got a new one. \nApparently it's twice as big. \nLet's go! - He said it's the one at the end. \n- There it is! Look! It's HUGE! Calm down. \nWe're here, Father. \n(Jack) Feck off. \nI think it's the best caravan in the whole world. \nDougal? Where's the trailer with all the stuff in it? Next you'll tell me you didn't lock the front door! Ah, Ted, come on Drink! In a minute, Father, I promise you. \nThis is great, isn't it, Ted? Telly and all. \nThis is what it's all about. \n(Woman ) Wait a second! You've got to do my back! (Man ) I'm wrinklin' like a raisin in there. \nI'll be back in a sec. \nFather Ted Crilly, Craggy Island Parochial House, Craggy Island. \nThat's C-R-A-G-G-Y Island. \nHonestly, Officer, I can't apologise enough God, that was so embarrassing! Ted, if that's not our one, which one is? (Door creaks) Sure, this is great. \nAnd it is bigger than last year's one. \nWhat'll we do first, Ted? We'll take it easy for a while, just get settled into the old caravan. \nRight, that's enough of that. \nWhere'll we go? Here's a booklet, Ted. \nPlaces of interest. \nSt kevin's Stump Mmm, that sounds good. \nThe Magic Road! Oh-ho! Two places of interest. \nWhat's the Magic Road, Ted? A bizarre natural wonder where everything's gone haywire and nothing works like it should. \nA bit like you, Dougal. \nExcept it's a road. \nI still don't understand. \nIt's a kind of a mad road? It's called a strange phenomenon. \nIf you took off a car's hand-brake, it'd roll UP-hill. \nAnd water flows UP it. \nThat's as mad as what you told me about the loaves and fishes! No, Dougal. \nThat's not mad. \nThat's when our Lord got one or two bits of food and turned it into a whole pile of food for dinner. \nGod, He was fantastic, wasn't He? Ah, He was brilliant. \n- Father, have any preferences? - HOLIDAY! Yes, we're on holiday. \nWould you like to go anywhere? - WHAT? - Would you like to go somewhere? WHO ARE YOU? I was asking, would you like to go somewhere now that we're here? - Perhaps for a lovely walk? - I LIkE CAkE! Yes, I think I'll just stop talking to Father Jack now. \nWhere am I? What's that thing there? Are those my feet? Let's get him to sleep and head off ourselves. \nOk, Fatherinto your box. \nDrink! Arse! Girls! Dri (Snoring) Let's go and look for the Magic Road. \nThe holiday starts here! Come on, let's play Scrabble. \nDid you bring the travel Scrabble? I brought the normal Scrabble AND the travel Scrabble. \nTravel Scrabble for travelling and the normal for when we arrived. \nGood man. \nAh, no, now that I think of it, I didn't bring either of them. \n- Right. \n- God, I'm an awful eejit. \nSowhat do we do for the next two weeks? Will I put on the kettle? Yeah, go on. \n(kettle hums) Must be one of the ones that clicks off automatically. \nYes Bit of steam there. \nIncidentally, did you bring any teabags? No. \nRight! (kettle clicks off) kettle's boiled there, Ted. \nHmm, yeah. \nWill I put more water in and turn it on again? No, I liked it best the first time. \nMaybe we could turn it on with no water at all, see what happens. \nI don't think you should do that. \nIt would just blow up. \nYou'd be picking lumps of metal out of your face for a year. \nYou'd have puffy fish lips bigger than your face. \nLike Father Bigley. \nExactly like Father Bigley. \nMaybe that's what happened to him. \n. \n. \nready or not. \n- Found you. \n- Ahh! It's your go. \nOnetwo threefour fivesix Ok, one last time. \nThese are small, but the ones out there are far away. \nSmall . \n. \nfar away. \nAh, forget it! Ted, you know how your eyes sometimes play tricks on you? - I know! Father Larry Duff! - Ah, Larry! He sometimes comes around this area. \nHe's tremendous fun. \nI'll call him on his mobile phone. \nI got him one for Christmas. \nHe's always complaining that nobody rings him. \n(Humming cheerfully) (Ringing) AHHHHHH! Must have it switched off. \nWhy's it called St kevin's Stump? It doesn't say. \nSo is this what all holidays are like, Ted? Actuallyyeah. \nAnyway, we'd better get back to Jack. \nHe said he'd stay put by the cliffs. \n(Snoring) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Can we go over to the rock and back, Ted? Well Come on, Ted, we're on holidays. \nLive a little. \nAll right, but then back to Jack. \nDrink! Drink! Dri-i-i-i-i-i! (Thud) Well, here we are. \nWill we go over to that fence now? No, we might just blow up with excitement. \nLet's save something for next week. \n(Woman moaning) Father Ted Crilly, Craggy Island Parochial House C-R Sure, you know all that. \nListen, you know the business of reporting missing persons? I've heard of it, yes. \nDoes it cost money to report a missing person? - No. \n- Great. \nWe've lost one of our party - Father Jack Hackett. \nGod, how would you describe him? - Mid-fifties - To mid-eighties. \nTremendous smell of vegetables. \n- Angry. \nVery angry man. \n- Hates children. \nLikes the odd drink. \nAnd don't come up on him from behind, he won't like that at all. \nOne thing - do you carry those electric stunner gadgets? - No. \nWhy? - Oh, no reason. \nRight, anything else I can do while I'm here? Want to confess to any unsolved murders or anything? No, we're fine for the old unsolved murders. \nSome holiday this is turning out to be! Come on. \nNow Jack's gone, there'll be more room in the caravan. \n# Ebony and ivory # Live together in perfect harmony # Side by side on my piano keyboard # Oh, Lord, why can't we-e-e-e # - Ted! - Hello, Noel. \nWhat are you doing here? Well, this is our caravan - Father O'Rourke offered it to us! - Yes, so I see. \nHe must say it to everyon.\nRoom for two more in the St Luke's Youth Group? - (Groan ) - Motion passed! Sit down and we'll have a song. \nWill you sing one, Ted? No, I won't, thanks You've a lovely voice! Very like Celine Dion! We can dance, then! Tony, stick on the Riverdance album! Actually Actually, Noel, I'm quite tired. \nWhat? Actually, we're all a bit exhausted from the old singing. \nSome of us overdid it down the old local last night! Gerry Fields knows who I'm talking about! Huh, what, eh? Yeah. \nWe arrived back at God! it must have been half ten! And some of us crawled in! Janine Reilly knows what I'm talking about! - Don't you?! - Yeah And she wasn't the only one! Tony Lynch! TONY LYNCH! He knows! Look at him, all sweetness and light! He wasn't when he crawled into bed at ten past eleven! Hello. \nFather Noel Furlong. \nYou're a fine young fella. \nWhat age would you say I am? Guess. \nWhat age would you say? He knows. \nDon't tell him! Go on, guess. \nWhat would you say? Ted, haven't seen you in ages. \nHow are you? # I SAW THE WHOLE OF THE MOON # There at the turnstiles with the wind at your heels # You stretched for the stars and you know how it feels # Too high # Too far # Too soon, you saw the whole of the moon # # Dirty old town # Dirty old to-o-own! # Oh, God, Ted, they have me worn out! They're a mad crowd! What time is it? Half ten! know what? We should all go to bed. \nWhere's Tony Lynch off to? Probably to get some heroin! No, I'm just going to the toilet, Father. \nAnyone else need to go? Ted, Dougal, are you Ok? We're grand, thanks, Noel. \nSure you don't need a little tinkle? I'm fine, thanks. \nI'll go again. \nDon't keep it in, your bladder could go mental. \n- Yes - My friend Father Sweeney, he had a bladder about the size of a Terry's Chocolate Orange NOEL! I REALLY I'm fine. \nOk? I'm fine. \nYou're like a bunch of camels! Anyway, we'll get the sleeping bags out. \nWill it not be a bit cramped? Not at all. \nThe more the merrier! (Noel) St Colum's had a great football team in the mid-'50s. \nThey won the Father Fitzgibbon Cup. \nFather Fitzgibbon. \nThe thing about him was he LOOkED like a cup! Great big ears like handles! Do you remember him, Ted? Ted? Do you remember? YES! I remember him, Noel. \nOooohh! Who's a bit of a Moaning Michael tonight? God Almighty, it's nearly six o'clock in the morning! I think what we should all do now is TELL A FEW GHOST STORIES! - Ted? - Yes? I'm going mad. \nYes, let's get out of here, let's go home. \n(Noel) Whoooo! Who's that now? Is that Gerry Fields heading off to the disco? We're just heading out for some fresh air. \nDon't forget to bring us back some! Right soyou big feckin' eejit! What about Jack? Chances are he's on Craggy Island. \nHe has an amazing homing instinct. \nWe'll find him with a smile on his face and his arms outstretched to welcome us back. \nWhat? Well, maybe not the smile on his face or the outstretched arms or the welcome back, but he's probably there. \nOh, God, your man! Don't let him see us! Gerry! Gerry! Gerry! - Open! Please open! - He's a fair bit away yet. \nMight be worth speeding up there a bit, Ted. \nSorry about that. \nBloody perverts! He's probably very cold now his towel's blown away. \n(Dougal) Maybe we should let him off. \nI've been thinking about it, but I'm sure he'll start giving out to us. \n- Pretend we didn't see him. \n- I doubt he'd believe us. \n- We'd better let him off, Ted. \n- Oh, all right. \nI suppose so. \n- Get out of the car! - Hello again. \nGet out of the car. \nRight! I think he's calming down a bit. \n- (Breaking glass) - Ah, now! Now! Come on! There's absolutely no need for that type of nonsense! He's puncturing the tyres, Ted. \nYou're impressing nobody with that type of thing! God, Ted, I'm so tired. \nMaybe we should go back. \nOh, no! I'm not going anywhere near Noel Furlong again. \nGod knows what they're up to by now! (Irish jig) (Horn ) Ted, it's a big truck! It can give us a lift! Oh, thank God! Hello, Fathers. \nTom, thank God, Tom! We need a lift. \nFair enough, Fathers. \nI'll open the door. \n(Rumbling and whooshing) Sorry about that, Fathers. \n(Mumbling) Father, you're awake! Thank God! It took us ages to pull you on board. \n(Muttering) Will you have something to drink? Coming now, ready or not."

      "It's a big waste. \nChewing gum for the eyes. \nNo, thanks, Ted. \nAnyway, I've got these crisps here. \nI get a cheese and onion one and a salt and vinegar one and I eat them in the same go. \nThat leak is getting worse, Dougal. \nWe'll have to move himself and put that bucket under it. \nRight. \nFair enough, Ted. \nI'm a happy camper! God, that'll cost a fortune to fix. \nWhere will we get the money? How can we raise some money? Hmm Yes, I know! A-ha! A-ha - Are you thinking what I am? - I think so. \nYes! But now, wait, I'm not sure. \nWhat? I mean, it is a big step and where will we get the guns? What are you talking about? Actually, I might've been thinking something different. \nYou thought we were going to rob a bank, didn't you? I did. \nDougal, this isn't a Bruce Willis film. \nI was thinking more along the lines of a raffle. \n- What'll we have as a prize, though? - You got me there, Ted. \nUnder diocese rules, we're allowed a raffle prize every couple of years. \nIt's stopped, Ted. \nWe have to move him. \nWhere's the thing for waking him up? There it is. \n(Ted) Father Father, it's only us. \nGET TO FECk! - Come on, Father - Drink! Don't drink that, Father, no! It's Feckin' water! . \n. \nand the island hasn't been given anything to raffle since those two bags of coal in 1964. \nI-I think we're entitled, under the rules of the diocese Oh, that'd be great! That's wonderful! Thank you very much, Your Grace! Thanks again. \nAll right. \nBye, Bishop Brennan. \nBye. \nNo luck, then? Lots of luck, Dougal. \nWe're being given a car. \nA car! That's a brilliant prize! It's not that unusual. \nFather Finnegan got one. \nYou know him, the Dancing Priest - dances for peace. \nOh, yeah. \nIs he still going? Yes, indeed. \nHe danced across America last year. \nNew York to Los Angeles. \nHe was mugged about once every 15 miles. \nGreat! We'll have the roof sorted in no time. \nDid you hear that, Father? (Mrs Doyle ) Cup of tea, Fathers? No, thanks, Mrs Doyle. \nWhat do you think of her? Nice. \nAre you sure you won't have a cup? - It's our raffle prize. \n- Right. \nJust a drop in your hand? Go inside. \nI'll take the tray. \nAll right. \nI'll put the kettle on in case you want some more. \nOh, God, Ted! There's a dent in the car! What?! - Where's the dent? - Just there, Ted. \nGod, how did that happen? When you hit that fella on the bike. \nDon't mention that to anyone. \nAnyway, I saw him get up. \nIt's not too bad. \nI can straighten it out with a hammer. \nHave a look in that box. \nOops, I didn't mean to do that. \nI'll just tap it the other way. \nIt's no use. \nYou'll never get it absolutely right. \n(Sighing) I thought I had it there a while ago, you know. \nShe was looking all right. \nBut like an eejit I kept banging away. \nYou're a perfectionist, Ted, you know? It's not too bad. \nLet's have another look. \n(Ted) Nono, we can't give that away as a prize. \nWhy not sleep on it? See how you feel in the morning? Maybe you're right. \n(Ted) AH, JESUS, WE'RE DEAD! OH, GOD ALMIGHTY! Calm down there, Ted! Come on! Calm down? We've just destroyed a car that's worth seven grand! Come on, Ted. \nIt'll look better in the morning. \nDougal, we're dead. \nThe Bishop will kill us! We're dead! We're dead! We're dead! Thanks, Dougal. \nI probably needed that. \nBut don't ever do it again. \nNow, what are we gonna do? - We could run away. \n- No, they'd find us. \n- They always do. \n- Oh, right. \nWhat about that other fella? The Dancing Priest. \nFinnegan! Yes! It'd be the same type of car! How could we get him to give it to us? Maybe Maybe we could just get a lend of it. \nBut the raffle winner won't want to give it back. \nNow, Dougal, this is going to sound very, very immoral, but stay with me. \nWhat if What if we organised the raffle so that we won it? Then we could bring the car back. \nOooooohhhhh! Oooh, that'd be terribly wrong. \nI don't think we should do that. \nIt wouldn't be cheating, really. \nIt would just be a case of structuring the raffle so the return reaches the benefactors rather than the beneficiaries. \nHmm. \nDougal, seriously. \nListen. \nIf Bishop Brennan finds out we wrecked the car, he WILL kill us. \nAnd murder is a terrible, terrible sin, Dougal. \nSo, by committing this little sin, we'll be saving a bishop's soul! Fair enough, then, Ted. \n(Violent sneezing) Come on, Father. \nWe're off to see the Dancing Priest. \n(Birds squawking) (Jack) Feckin' feckin' eejit! Gobshites, all of you! Right, off we go. \n(Clattering) (Ted) God, look at it! It's the same colour and all. \nYou mind Jack. \nI won't be a moment. \nBut, Ted! (Sneezes) ( # Pop music) Liam. \nOh, Ted! Come on in. \nWill you join me? What? Me dance? Oh, I'm not much of a dancer, no. \nCome on, Ted. \nPrayer isn't the only way to praise God. \n- And it keeps you fit. \n- All right, then. \nYou said something on the phone about borrowing the car. \nYou'd be doing a great favour. \nOh, don't be silly. \nJust take care of it. \nDon't give it away in a raffle or something(!) Somebody saw you on TV in a documentary, you were in Belfast. \nThat wasn't me, a younger fella ripped off the idea! Don't like talkin' about him! Well, I'd better head on. \nThanks again. \nNo problem. \nBye, Ted. \nBingo! No luck, then, Ted? (Ted) Dougal, you'll leave a mark on the window. \nAre we there yet? Dougal, we won't be there for a while. \nYes, Father Ted Crilly saves the day again! How are you doing back there, Father? - (Sneezes) - Aw! What have you been drinking? It's like acid! Here, try this. \nThis'll clear you up. \nAren't cars great, Ted? Look, it's a long drive. \nYou have a little sleep. \nOh, right so, Ted. \n(Radio ) 'This is Laszlo St Pierre on the night shift, 'taking you through until 3am' 'Cock-a-doodle-doo! This is the John Morgan Morning Show. \n'It's a beautiful day so let's start off with some Motown magic!' ( # Motown intro ) God, I almost drifted off for a moment there. \nNearly home. \n(Ted) Right, the raffle. \nLet's go through it again. \nI'll fill the hat with tickets all with the same number on them - 11. \nThat's easy to remember, Ted. \nAnd we'll make sure that you have that number. \nRight. \nSo we won't have to cheat at all. \n- That's HOW we're cheating, Dougal. \n- Oh, right, Ok So let me get this straight. \nYou'll be wearing the hat? No, I won't be wearing any hats. \nThe tickets will be in the hat. \nBut you'll put on the hat to give me the signal? I won't be giving you any signals! I'll just pull out your ticket and you'll collect the prize! - There's a prize, Ted? What is it? - The car! Oh, right, yeah. \nHere's the sandwiches for tonight. \nOh, wait a minute, I forgot to do my test! What test, Mrs Doyle? I select a sandwich at random and try it. \nIf it doesn't meet my standards, I put the lot in the bin. \nThey're fine. \n- Right, so, are we all sorted? - Ho, raring to go, Ted! - Who's doing the disco? - Father Billy O'Dwyer. \nThe Spinmaster! Great. \nActually, I can't wait. \nI bet I sell a load of tickets. \nI bet I sell more than you. \nHmm. \nIt's like The Sting. \nI'm Robert Redford and you're Paul Newman. \n(Man on PA) 'Testing - one, two, one, two. \n' Ground Control to the Spinmaster! Oh, Ted! How are ya? Fine. \nGod, it's like NASA. \nHow do you keep track of it all? It's quite simple, really. \nHere we have the turntables, which I control from the mixing desk. \nI can flip between records if I want to get a bit of an old jam going. \nI can't wait. \nWhat records have you got? - Records? - A bit of the Bee Gees, I suppose? - Oh, God. \n- Billy, what's up with you? I forgot the records, Ted. \nWhat?! Have you not got any records? Now, hold on a second I might have one. \nI think I have one out in the car. \nCup of tea, Father? Would you like to be the first to buy a raffle ticket? I'd love to. \nI haven't taken part in a raffle in donkey's years. \nI think I'm in with a great chance today. \n- (Giggling) - Shut up, Dougal! - How many? - Just the one. \nAh, all right. \n- My lucky number never lets me down. \n- Which one's that? - 11. \n- What? - Ehwell, we're out of 11s. \n- I'm your first customer. \nYes, yes. \nButI think this one came without 11s. \nI'll give you a 10 and a one and that'll add up to 11. \nYou can have both for 50p. \nNo, I don't think so. \nI'll have my money back. \nMrs Doyle, it's for the roof Sorry, Father. \nIncredible woman! Now, I wonder where Jack's got to. \n- He's with Father Purcell. \n- I better rescue him! They're just chatting. \nPurcell's the most boring priest in the world. \nHe was working in Nigeria, and he woke up to find everyone had had enough of him and gone off in a boat. \nIt sank after a mile and they were eaten by alligators. \nI'd better go. \n. \n. \nwe run the gas off the electricity and the electricity off the gas and we save 200 a year! But then a few weeks later - God, I'll never forget it, now - we got a new boiler. \n- All right, Fathers? - HELP ME! Hello, Ted. \nI was telling Father Jack about the thing there last year. \n- How did you fare with yours? - I don't know Because you know, they have no morals and no respect for human life. \nBut what they do have, and no one can deny this, they have the finest collection of boilers in the world. \nAnd I include Canada in that. \nFine, Anthony, I want to borrow Jack for a moment. \nTHANk CHRIST! Father? Ahh, I remember the first time I saw that boiler! Beautiful! Would you like a ticket, Father? Did you get those specially? You can buy them down the shop. \nAny number you like - ahoneseven - 112 - 112? All the way up to 409, I think it is. \nIf you want more, they send off for them. \nThey come back in an envelope. \nNormal kind of thing. \nRectangular, four corners, you know. \nThat's the way I like them anyway, the old envelopes. \nNo round envelopes for me! No way, Hose. \n(Purcell) Sid Vicious, now. \nThat was a grand name, wasn't it? He had trouble with the drugs Oh-ho-ho! Yes! Tickets for the raffle. \nAnybody who hasn't bought a ticket, come over here. \nThank you very much. \nThank you. \nSorry about the wait, folks - trouble with the old disco. \nLuckily, I've got a few old pals to do a couple of numbers. \nPlease welcome Fathers Tiernan, Rafter, Cafferty and Leonard! ( # Electronic music) Billy, where have you been? Ted! Found the record! All right. \nHow about a ticket? Gambling, Ted. \nRuined me father and me grandfather. \nBoth of them, Ted, died without a penny to their name. \nIt won't happen to me. \nGod, it's for charity. \nIt's not real gambling. \nAll right, then, go ahead. \nGreat. \nHow many? - 2,000? - I'll do you a cheque. \nNo, I can't take it, that's too much. \nI can handle it, Ted! I've a few friends who lend me cash from time to time. \nNo, you shouldn't throw around that kind of money. \nTed, I need another ticket book. \nThis one's run out. \nAlready? How could you sell out already?! Don't ask me. \nI can hardly keep a straight face. \nWhat was it, Billy - 2,000? (Music continues) Need more drink! Car! ( # The Specials: \"Ghost Town\") (Record ends) (Music starts) Right, let's go. \nYou know what to do? - Thunderbirds are go, Ted! - Ok, come on. \nThank you, Father Billy. \nLet's get on to the important stuff - the raffle! The last raffle I was at was very interesting because the people who ran the raffle actually won it. \nSo it's not unusual for that to happen now and again. \nRight? Ok, the winning number is Number 11! Number11. \nNumber 11. \nIf anyone has that number, come up on stage! What's that, Father McGuire? You have the winning number? What? A round of applause for our very own Father Dougal McGuire! God Almighty, what were you doing? Sorry. \nI was looking at the ticket upside-down. \nWell, congratulations, Father Dougal. \nAnyway, what a fantastic evening we've had. \nWe've raised enough to repair the roof and had a great time. \nSo let me just thank you for coming and ask you to stand for our national anthem. \n( # \"Ghost Town\") For God's sake, I'll have the money for you next week! Please, please, one more chance, that's all I ask. \nPlease! Please! Oh, thanks very much, Mrs Doyle. \nFor God's sake, have some pity! I'm a priest! They have you every way, you know. \nI was in the AA there for a while. \n- The insurance was very expensive. \n- Oh, right I had to crash the car just to get the money back. \nThen they had witnesses who saw me steer it towards the wall. \nThere was talk of me going to jail for a while and Ah, it's Yourself. \nWhat can I do for you, Mrs Doyle? Terrible news. \nIt's Father Finnegan! - He's had a heart attack! - No! The doctors warned him to cut it down to 12 hours a day, but he couldn't stop dancing! That's terrible news. \n- What's up, Ted? - Father Finnegan had a heart attack. \nNo! Are there any more Chipsticks? Does that mean we can keep the car? Dougal! The man has just Wait! You're right! We can! Father FECk OFF! Where did you get the air freshener? - Car! - Oh, God. \nDrived the car! Not the new car? Tell me the truth - have you been drinking? Yes! From the beginning. \nWhere did you drive? Shops! Drink! Corner. \nStopped. \nGot out. \n- Truck. \n- A truck? Two trucks. \nLet's take a look. \nMaybe there's something we can salvage. \nIt's not that bad, Ted. \nYes, God, I thought it'd be much worse than that. \nOh bollocks. \nDougal, how is this \"not that bad\"? At least we've got the raffle money. \nPlease! Just give me 24 hours! Please! (Line goes dead) (Thunder) (Man on TV) 'So we'll probably be seeing a lot more rain, 'at least until July, or possibly until August. \n' God Almighty! Imagine anyone being so dishonest as to steal raffle money from a priest! Well, now, the raffle WAS rigged, Ted. \nI suppose we'll be Ok, as long as a tree doesn't fall through the roof. \n(Thunder crashes) For a moment, I thought (Crash) This is a piece of advice my father gave to me. \nNow, this not only refers to lagging, but all forms of insulation. \nHe said, \"Don't ever\" No, no, it was, \"Always! Always re\" No! It was, \"Never\" Oh, I've forgotten. \nNever mind. \nWhat's your favourite humming noise? Would it be \"hmmmm\" or would it be \"hmmm-MMMMM\"? The first one there, that's the sound of a fridge. \nThe second one, that's the sound of a man humming. \nYou never hear a woman humming. \nI knew a woman once, but she died soon afterwards. \nNow, if you push me, I'd have to say my favourite colour was grey no, blue, a soft blue, with a hint of grey. \nNo, orange. \nOrange. \nThat's it, I remember. \nI have an extension put on the house, now. \nI put it on the extension, so the house is in a circle now, you see?

      "God, I'm not reading that book any more. \nIt's very scary altogether, Ted. \n- Ted? - Yes, what? Did you ever see a ghost? Well, I'll tell you something that happened to me once. \nIt was years ago. \nI was staying with my great aunt in Connemara. \nIt was a big house, miles from anywhere. \nDuring the Great Famine, a cruel landlord and his beautiful daughter lived there. \nThe story is he forbade the daughter from marrying a young soldier. \nIt broke her heart. \nIn her despair, she hung herself in her bedroom. \nThe room that I was staying in was that very bedroom. \nI remember it was icy cold lit by a single candle. \nI was drifting off to sleep when suddenly, I heard a strange creaking noise. \n- Was it a ghost? - No. \nSo, no, I've never seen a ghost. \n- I saw one. \n- Really? Yes. \nIt was a man all dressed in black. \nI came down one night for a glass of milk and he was just sitting there in front of the TV just there. \nHe had this strange grey hair, even though he wasn't very old Dougal, Dougal. \nCould this have been me at all? Ahh, right! (Helicopter) (Crash) Right, that should do it. \nFor pity's sake. \n(Toilet flushes) That's working now, Ted. \nIt's broken again! Maybe it only works when my head is in it! Ted, we should call the plumber. \nNo, don't get them involved. \nI'd be too embarrassed to tell them how I broke it - trying to give it an extra hard flush. \nWell, now, Ted, I have to say it was fine for me - it was a good powerful flush. \nI was thinking more about Jack. \nYou know when he's involved. \nYou want to get that stuff away as fast and as hard as possible. \nBest thing would be to have it pop up somewhere in Sierra Leone! Oh, you're right there, Ted. \nA-ha. \nA-ha! I thought Jack had stashed something in here! Ok, let's try it now. \n(Powerful flush) Girls! - Bloody hell! - Good news, Ted? No. \nVery, very bad news. \nIt's the Holy Stone of Clonrichert. \nThey're upgrading it to a Class II relic. \n- Great! - No, it's not great. \nThey'll send over a few bishops and we'll have to behave! I thought there was something up. \nWasn't someone cured there? No, someone was LURED there. \nPaddy Short. \nAnd then those fellas beat him with sticks. \n- That was it, yeah. \n- The Holy Stone. \n(Ted) It must be holier than we thought. \nPerhaps it's that fella from England. \nHe touched it and he grew a beard. \nWeird. \nThat'd be enough to upgrade it to a Class I. \nOh, Class I would be very rare. \nThat'd be bringing people back to life time travel, cloning dinosaurs Very rare. \nThere's millions of relics. \nHow do they know which ones to do? Well, they have to think about the history of the relic, how many miracles can be attributed to it. \nAll sorts of considerations go into it. \nWhat about the Holy Stone of Clonrichert? Whatever. \nAh, come on, cheer up. \nIt may never happen. \n- It IS happening! They're coming. \n- Oh, right. \nWell, who cares, anyway? They strip the wallpaper, fumigate the place and they're gone. \nWhat's so bad about that? Dougal, they're bishops! Oh, right, yes. \nWhat is this confusion you have about bishops? Do you understand what they actually do? Nothing to do with fumigating houses at all. \nHave you got that? Got it. \nAnyway, let's play a game, get your mind off it. \n- Chess or Buckaroo? - Er Actually, I wouldn't mind chess today. \n- Really? - Only joking. \nBuckaroo, of course. \nBut only if you're ready for a good trashing. \nDougal, you've never actually beaten me, ever. \nOh, right, yeah. \nStill, eh? Buckaroo, the sport of kings(!) It won't be so bad. \nThe bishops will have a look around, see we're a normal, everyday parish and go away. \nNothing to worry about at all. \nSo the ceremony's on Thursday and they're arriving tomorrow. \n- This is crucial. \nListen to me. \n- All right, Ted. \nThese bishops are very important. \nI'll stay around you just in case. \nSo you don't say anything you shouldn't. \nLike what? Like what you said to Bishop Lindsay when he asked me where I was when kennedy was shot. \nOh, yeah. \nYou overreacted slightly. \nHe wasn't accusing me of anything. \nAll right, so. \nTed, do you know any of the bishops who are coming? What are they like? Bishop Facks is a good old pal of Father Larry Duff's. \nI'll ring Larry on his mobile. \nIt's got an extra-loud bleep. \nShh! (Drum roll) (Mobile rings) (Audience ) Ooh! (Ringing continues) God Almighty. \nWhy does he have a mobile if he never picks it up? And we have the problem with Jack. \nCouldn't we just hide him for a couple of days? No, they'd hear him shouting \"Girls!\" We could train Jack to say something apart from \"drink\", \"feck\" or \"girls\" like the dog on That's Life. \nDougal, Father Jack may be bad, but he's not a dog. \n(Scratching at door) There he is now. \nHe probably wants to go out. \nWait. \nMaybe we could teach him to say one or two things. \nNothing too specific, a few all-purpose sentences. \nLike \"That would be an ecumenical matter. \n\" Yes, any religious question can be answered by that. \nThat's what I always say. \nThat's the great thing about Catholicism. \nIt's so vague, nobody knows what it's all about. \nI think it might work, Dougal. \nI know it'll work. \nIt WILL work! It won't work, will it, Ted? It won't, no. \nBut we have to try. \nWe'll have a little elocution lesson Drink! You can't say that when the bishops come here. \n- Feck! - Or that! - Girls! - Go back to \"drink\" for the moment. \n- Drink! - Have a look at this. \nHave a go at the first one. \n\"That\". \nDrink! No, \"That\". \nDrink! Come on, concentrate. \n\"That\". \n- Drink! - \"That\"! - Drink! - \"That\"! - Drink! - \"That\"! - Drink! - \"That\"! - Drink! - Now, come on, I know you can do it! There's a drink in it for you. \n- Drink? - Yes, I promise. \nTry again. \n- \"That\" - Th-th-th-th . \n. \nth-th-drink! Come on, you almost had it! \"That\"! Th-th-th-th-th-th . \n. \nth-th-that! - Great! - THAT! Brilliant! And the next one - \"That would\" That wouou - Would - Wou Wou-ou-oudrink! Mrs Doyle, you left the cooker on. \nAll right, Father, I'll be there in a second. \nRight, Father, everything's ready. \nThere's a big vat of tea steaming away and I've arranged the Ferrero Rocher in a big triangular pile. \nOh, I'm so excited - taking on three bishops all at once! I can't wait! Right I think this will be the greatest moment of my career. \nIt's as if my whole life was leading up to Mrs Doyle! I'm over here! - Oh, so you are. \n- Mrs Doyle Ahhhh! Mrs Doyle, have you got your contacts in? No. \nA dog ran off with them! I suppose now I'll have to wear the glasses. \nI don't like wearing them, Father. \nI feel they make me look like a frustrated old bag! Oh, I can't imagine that. \nI imagine they look absolutely Rahhhhh! God, Father, are they that bad? Nono It's just a scary film I was thinking of. \nThey're fine, really. \nGreat, well, that's much better. \nUmI'll just go and check on the tea, so - (Mrs Doyle ) Father? - Hmm? Father, I have absolutely no idea where the door is. \nNo sign of 'em yet, Ted. \n(Ted) Dougal, er, Dougal They're here. \nSorry about that, Bishop O'Neill. \nYou were saying? Yes. \nA simple ceremony. \nWe'll just need a little incense. \nIncense? I don't know if we Dougal, do we have any incense? There was a spider in the bath last night. \nNo, Dougal, incense. \nIn-cense. \nOh, right, yes. \nNo, I don't think so. \nRemember when we ran out of incense and used Windolene Ahem! Well, I'm sure we can find some. \nSo, are you doing much upgrading around the country? Last month, we elevated a mushroom field in Cavan to Class III! Great! Our work takes us all over the country. \nIt gives us a chance to get in touch with the ordinary clergy - or the ground troops, as I call them. \nYes. \nWe're trying to organise a large meeting at the end of the year where all ranks of the clergy can discuss their views with representatives of the lay community. \nWhat do you think, Father Crilly? Sorry, what? Do you think a close relationship with the lay community is desirable, or should a certain distance be maintained? Yes, ergood question. \nWell, you know, I think we should involve the lay community butkeep them at a distance. \nHow much of a distance? Couple of miles? Here we are now, tea for everyone. \nOOOHH! - Are you all right, Your Grace? - Yes, I I had a minor heart attack last year. \nI have to take it easy. \nI got a bit of a fright there. \n(Ted) Right. \nIt's not a problem. \nJust give us a warning when you're going to do anything sudden. \n- Arghhh! - Dougal, what are you doing?! Sorry, Ted. \nI just remembered Aliens is on after the news. \nDougal, for God's sake! I'm sorry, Bishop Jordan. \n- Did you not hear what he said? - I know but it's the director's cut! Let's have a lads' night in - Ooooh - Dougal! Dougal, shut up! A heart attack? That's rare enough these days. \n- There were prayers said - Why can't we look at Aliens? - Bishop O'Neill is speaking! - They'd love it! - They wouldn't! - Bishops love sci-fi. \nDOUGAL, WE ARE NOT WATCHING ALIENS! Anyway, back to religion. \nDo you see what I'm getting at? We must fight back against the anti-clerical bias of the media! Yes Ferrero Rocher? Father Ted, with these Rocher you are really spoiling us. \nMrs Doyle. \nOh, right. \nBishop, you were saying? I was saying we have to fight back against the media, we must make our voice heard! Where is Father Hackett? Mrs Doyle, could you get Father Hackett for us now? Certainly, Father. \nI must say, they keep you on your fee.\nMy housekeeper isn't the best, I'm afraid. \nSometimes I think it's ME should be making the tea for HER! Mrs Doyle (Ted) Mrs Doyle \"Making the tea for HER!\" (Hysterical laughter continues) Sorry about that. \nAh, here's Father Hackett now. \nHe's been looking forward to your visit. \nHaven't you, Father? Yes! This is Bishop O'Neill. \nDon't get up! Yes! - This is Bishop Facks - Yes! - This is Bishop Jordan - Yes! They're looking after you, then, Father? That would be an ecum - Ahem! - Yes! I was saying, I'm looking forward to discussing the social effects of some of the Church's thinking on issues of personal morality. \n(Whispers) Ecumenical That would be an ecumenical matter! Yes, I I suppose it would. \n- Good point, Father. \n- Yes! That's what we need - a more positive attitude, like Father Hackett's! What? I agree. \nI can see Father Hackett making a valuable contribution over the next few days. \n- Oh, God! - Yes! Heavenly Father, hear our prayer. \nWe pray that this rock be upgraded to a Class II relic, and by the grace of God, bring healing to all those who pass within two and a half to three feet of it, at your discretion. \nAnd may all who are healed in such a way give glory to you, our Lord, through your earthly form of this Class II relic. \n- Amen. \n- Amen. \nEamonn. \nI'm sorry for detaining you, Father. \nWe'll catch up with the others. \nYes! I so admire your positive attitude, Father. \nSo many people are cynical about such things. \nYou can hardly open a newspaper these days without reading some anti-clerical article - written by some bearded leftie! - Yes! A spell in the army would do them good! That would be an ecumenical matter. \nOh, of course, Father! It's the media that's the real enemy, involving earthly, unspiritual pleasures! Temptation! Ecumenical! Yes! How right you are, Father! How right you are! So, Father, do you ever have any doubts about the religious life? Is your faith ever tested? Anything you've been worried about? Any doubts you've been having about any aspects of belief? Anything like that? Well, you know the way God made us all, right, and He's looking down at us from Heaven and everything? And His son came down and saved everyone and all that? - Yes. \n- And when we die, we go to Heave.\nYes, what about it? That's the bit I have trouble with. \nThat is the key to the matter, Father. \nWhen you come face to face with death, it makes you think about things. \nI saw that film recently, Apollo 13, and it reminded me of my own brush with death. \nDo you know what I mean? You meanyou were in space when you had your heart attack? - No. \nHow could I be in space? - Sorry. \nNo, I suppose not. \nI meant I know what it's like to be close to death. \nYeah, great. \nI'm dying to use the old WC, so Yes, you do that. \nI'll stay here and take the air. \nSo, if God has existed forever, what did he do in his spare time before he made the earth and everything, you know? Well, we all have doubts. \nAnd what about not eating meat on Fridays? How come that's Ok now but it wasn't back then? Did people who ate meat on Fridays back then all go to hell or what? I mean, it's mad. \n- Not bothering you, is he? - No, no, it'sfascinating. \n(Toilet flushes) Oh! (Screaming) Oh, there you are. \nI hope you had a nice chat. \nIt was great. \nI reached some very interesting conclusions. \n- Oh? About what exactly? - Well It's nonsense, isn't it? - What is? - Religion. \n- Er - Think about it. \nVery little evidence. \nBlind faith, that's all we have to go on. \nThere's not a shred of proof! Nothing! Aliens? Now, there's something that might just be possible. \nBut everlasting life? Big demons sticking red-hot pokers up your arse for all eternity? I don't think so. \nThe whole religion thing, I just don't buy it. \nI've been struggling for some time, but Father McGuire was the first man to spell it out for me in black and white. \nDougal, what have you been up to? This man. \nThis man! Treasure him, Father Crilly! He has wisdom far beyond his years. \nThanks very much. \n(Bloodcurdling scream ) Quick! It's Bishop Jordan! I think he's dead! There! Oh, Lord! Yeah. \nThat's a dustbin, Mrs Doyle. \nThere! Oh, Lord! This is terrible! Where's Bishop Facks? We have to straighten out the media! That's the important thing, Father! And we have to do it . \n. \nnow! ARGHHHHH! Dougalthank you! You're welcome, Bishop. \nNo, no - Eddie. \nAre you sure you won't reconsider your decision? No. \nIt's too late. \nI'm off to India with a few friends. \nAh, there they are. \nSee you again, then. \nEr, Your Grace. \nThe Holy Stone Will it, er, still be a Class II when they, erremove it? (Dougal) Bye. \nGod bless. \nWent pretty well, I thought."

      "so he was having an affair with the sister when his wife was in hospital. \n- Wow. \n- Incredible, isn't it? So he makes the baby-sitter pregnant. \nHe doesn't know whether to stay with the wife, sister or the baby-sitter! - When's his next confession? - Tuesday.\nI'll keep you posted. \nAnyway, I'm really looking forward to this. \nMe, too. \nIt's great to take a day off. \nIt shouldn't be just work, work, work. \nIt's not as if everybody will join some mad religious cult just because we go for a picnic. \nI heard about those cults. \nEverybody dressing in black and saying our Lord's going to come back and judge us all. \nNo No, Dougal, that's us, that's Catholicism you're talking about.\nOh, right. \nRight. \nRight, here's the sandwiches for the picnic. \nThe rest are in the kitchen. \n- Great. \n- I hope you enjoy them, Father. \nI love a sandwich. \nAny flavour, as long as it isn't egg. \nYou know how much I hate egg. \nEven the smell brings me out in a rash. \nI wouldn't eat an egg sandwich if you paid me. \nStinking things! Remember me telling you, anything except egg? Anything but egg. \n- They're egg, aren't they? - Yes. \n- Great. \n- I'll eat them. \nI love egg. \nSometimes I think I like egg so much that I'll turn into a giant egg. \nI think that process has already begun. \n- Sorry, Ted? - No, nothing. \n- So, ready? - Ready as I'll ever be, Ted. \nI don't think I've looked forward to anything as much as this picnic. \n- Right, so. \n- Oh, I just remembered. \nI can't go. \n(Doorbell) Is Dougal in? - Hello, Father. \n- Hello, Sergeant. \nJust doing the rounds. \nOn the trail of some crazed murderer, no doubt. \n- What was that? - Sorry? - A crazed murderer! When was this? - I was only joking. \nOh, right. \nIf you ever hear of a crazed murderer, report it. \n- It'd give me something to do. \n- Right. \n- It's very quiet here. \n- It is, yes. \nSo if you hear of anything, you know. \nA car wrongly parked - anything. \nTax up-to-date on that car? - It is, yes. \n- Thought so. \nBye, Sergeant. \n- Who was that young priest, Father? - Oh, I don't know. \nSo Father McGuire isn't going on the picnic, then? No. \nNever mind. \nI'm meeting Larry Duff and a few of the lads. \nBetter give them a call. \n- All egg, yeah? - Yes. \n(Mobile phone rings) Hello? Ah, hello, Ted. \n- Hello, Larry. \nHow are you? - Ah, grand. \nBit of a problem, though. \nWe mightn't be able to make the picnic. \nAh, God, Larry. \nWhy? You know Father Williams who was driving us over? (Ted) 'Billy? What about him?' Well, they found a big box of machineguns in his house. \nDidn't think he'd be interested in that type of thing. \nAh, yeah, well. \nYou think you know someone Anyway, there you go. \nBye. \nBye Oh, well. \nJust myself, I suppose. \n(Father Jack mutters) - (Bottles clink) - Drink! It's not drink, Father. \nIt's just fizzy water. \nJacob's Creek Chardonnay, 1991! - You can tell just from the sound?! - Drink! Drink! Drink! Father, I was thinking of going on a little picnic. \nOn my own. \nOutside. \nYou wouldn't like it, Father. \nYou'd be much happier here. \nThat is I (Wind howls) - Here, d'you want one? - Ah, no, thanks, Father Lennon. \n- What time's your tea ready? - Frosty usually has it about six. \n- Who? - Frosty. \nFather Frost. \nOh, wow! Frosty. \nBrilliant! What d'you call YOUR fella? - Who, Ted? - Yeah. \nWell, just Ted. \nBut it's the way I say it, you know? - He's an awful eejit, isn't he? - Yeah! Here, which one do you prefer - Oasis or Blur? - Blur. \n- What?! Oasis! I mean Oasis! Father Damien, your tea is ready! I'll be in in a minute! (Snoring) Great! Here we go. \n(Man ) What the fup are you doing here? This is my fuppin' spot. \nGet the fup off! - Hit him, Frank. \n- Could you not go over there? No fuppin' way! F-U-P O-F-F. \nFup off! We come here every fuppin' Sunday. \n- But this is Saturday. \n- Hit him. \nI'll hit him for you. \nShe fuppin' would, and so would I, you fuppin' backstard! Why are you talking like that? So fup off, you grasshole! - But I don't see - Right! I'm callin' the fuppin' man! Hey! Hey! Hey! (Blows whistle furiously) What's the problem? Listen, this backstard priest is in our spot! - Look, we were just - Put the fork down. \n- What? Oh, I wasn't - Put the fork down! Put the fork DOWN! Now put your hands very slowly to your sides. \nSlowly! All right I'm going to put the megaphone down now, all right? Nice and easy. \nNow I'm going to reach inside my pocket, all right? Nice and slow. \nEverything's fine. \nCigarette? No. \nTo be honest, I'm just going home. \nFup off, you pedrophile! All right, come on. \nCome on. \nNothing to see here. \nBack to the picnic. \n(Blows whistle ) (Slams bottle down ) Ah, there you are. \nYou wouldn't believe the day I've had. \nI met the rudest couple. \nAnd that fella, Benson, with his bloody whistle. \nSomebody should take it off him. \nWhere did you go? I was with Father Damo Lennon. \n- He's over with Frosty. \n- Who? Eh, Father Frost. \nOh, yes. \nFATHER Frost. \nHe said they might come over for a holiday. \nFather Damo's great. \nWhy are you walking like that? - Like what, Ted? - Like a crab. \nOh, right. \nSorry, Ted. \n- Dougal, what's that? - What? This? Oh, nothing. \n- It's an earring. \n- Oh, right. \nIt is, all right. \nYou can't go round wearing an earring. \nAll the young priests wear them. \nFather Damo has one. \nOh, I see. \nDid Father Damo give you the idea? Yeah. \nHe's great. \nNext he'll be giving you crack cocaine or something. \nCrack cocaine. \nAh, come on, Ted. \nWell, you'll have to take it out. \nYou don't know what's going on with the young people. \nI was young once. \nThe things we got up to in the seminary! Me and the lads, once we mitched off to see a Dana concert. \nDana! No one's listening to Dana any more. \nYou'd be mad to listen to her. \nYeah? Father Bigley listens to Dana and he's not mad. \nWhy's he in that home, then? He's in that home because of those fires. \nThat's nothing to do with Dana. \nYou'll have to take that earring out. \nI should be allowed to do what I want. \nI am nearly 26. \nYou still treat me like I was 24. \nI'll start treating you like a 26-year-old when you start acting like a 26-year-old. \nAnyway, it's time for your bath. \nA bath! OH, NO! Hello, Father. \nHello, Father. \nAh, hello. \nHow are things? Fine! Fine! Good. \nI'll see you later. \nGo, go, go, go, go! You bastard! Slag! - Hello, Mary. \n- Hello, Father. \nOh. \n- Hello, Father. \n- Hello, John. \nMary was just washing my hair. \nShe has such lovely, soft hands. \nI was just looking for some firelighters. \nI'll get them. \nThey're out the back. \nI didn't know Sergeant Hodgins had a helicopter. \nOh, ye.\nHe had to get one in because of this whistle thing. \n- Oh. \nWhistle thing? - Yea.\nLook. \n(Mary) Isn't it terrible, Father? The whole island's talking about it. \nWho would've thought law and order - would break down on Craggy Island? - (Mary) God help us all, Father! Yes, but I mean, if it's only a whistle I had to buy myself a shotgun and everything. \nI wouldn't hesitate to use that, now. \nIf that man came in and tried to steal any of the whistles in here I'd blow his feckin' head off his shoulders! (Laughs nervously) Look. \nI have it cocked an' all so I can get the jump on him. \nWould it not be dangerous to have it cocked like that? Not at all, Father. \nSo long as you don't suddenly drop it. \n(John laughs) There. \nIf they don't work, bring them back and we'll give you a refund. \nOk, so. \nThanks very much. \nYou feckin' eejit! Give me that! Did you hear about the whistle being stolen? - Yes - I never thought I'd see the like. \nWhat next? Somebody'll be murdered and then where are we? Drive-by shootings in the night. \nIt'll be like Boyz N the Hood. \nThen they'll have whores selling their wares on the street. \nThe pimps'll be using crack to keep the whores under control. \n(Gunshot) I'm going to lock myself in the basement until they catch that fella. \nGoodbye. \nUnbelievable! They really are making too big a deal of this. \nAnd look - a special pull-out supplement on whistles! I don't know Dougal, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? This is Father Damo. \nHow're ya? Hello, Father. \nPlaying the old computer game there? (Phone ) Hello. \nFather Ted Crilly speaking. \nYes. \nAh! Father Frost. \nYes, I'll tell him. \nFather Damien, Father Frost says you're to go home. \nYour tea is ready. \nTell him I'm not going. \nI'm having dinner here. \nOh. \nAre you? Hello, Father? No, he's staying here for dinner. \nUm, Father Damien, Father Frost said you're to go home immediately. \nShite! Did you tell him I'm having dinner here? - Eryes. \n- Tell him to feck off, then. \nHe's happy enough here for the moment, Father. \nRight. \nOk. \nFather Frost says if you don't go home, he'll come and get you. \nI don't care what he does. \nHe's not the boss of me. \nRight All right, all right! I'm going. \nTell him I'm going. \nI'll see you, Dougal. \nHe's heading off now. \nYes, yes. \nOh, right, yeah. \nDougal, mind this for me. \n- Oh, right. \n- I'll get them later. \n- Frosty hates me smoking. \n- Ok, Damo. \n- You praying, yeah? - Oh, no. \nThey're, uhTed's. \n- See ya, right? - See ya. \n(Ted) Dougal! Oh, God! What does he want now? Consonant, please, Carol. \nVowel. \nAnother consonant. \nVowel. \nConsonant. \nRichard, where are you going? Dougal, I am not Richard Whiteley. \nGo back to sleep. \nYou're dreamin.\nConsonant. \nPut your clothes back on, Carol, I can't concentrate. \n- Tea, Father? - God Almighty! Why are you up? I always stay up in case one of you needs a cup of tea. \nHow long have you been doing this? - Oh, about three years now. \n- But we never get up at night. \nYou're up now, aren't you? Unless I'm hallucinating from lack of sleep. \nThat's happened before, all right. \nI'm just getting my jacket to go for a little walk. \nRight, so. \nDougal? Oh, no! Dougal Is there anything on your mind? Let me rephrase that. \nIs there anything you want to tell me about? Something bothering you? Like what, Ted? Have you done anything you might be embarrassed about? Have you done anything bad recently? Anything wrong? Wrong? You remember right and wrong, the difference between the two. \nPage one of How To Be A Catholic. \nHonestly, Dougal! This is very basic stuff. \nGive me an example of something that's wrong. \nJust give me a second, Ted. \nI, er I (Ted) Arson - there's one. \nMurder Swearing. \nSwearing, yeah. \n- Anything else? - Er Erm Er Lying? - Well done, Dougal! Yes! - Thanks, Ted. \nI Dougal, are you all right? I'm fine, Ted. \nI just need to sit down. \nSorry about that. \nProbably pushed you a bit hard. \nNo worries, Ted. \nDougal, something else that's wrong is stealing. \nWhat I'm trying to say is, it's wrong to steal. \n- Stealing is something you don't do. \n- Except you. \nYes What? - You're allowed to steal. \n- What're you talking about? The money from that Lourdes thing. \nDifferent thing altogether, Dougal. \nThat money was just resting in my account before I moved it on. \n- It was resting for a long time. \n- Yes, but - A good, long rest. \n- We're not talking about me! We're talking about YOU. \nIs there anything you want to tell me about? This, for example? Father, Sergeant Hodgins and Mr Benson are here. \nDougal, you just go out and getthe shears. \n- Right you are. \n- Sorry to disturb you. \nI thought we might meet and talk about this. \n- You've heard about the whistle? - Yes. \nWhen I saw my whistle had been stolen, I went into a state of shock and lost the use of my legs. \nWell, one of them, anyhow. \nThis one's fine but this one - completely lost all feeling. \nLook. \n(Screams in agony) - Yes. \n- Sweet Jesus! The shock also affected his memory. \nIt's actually THA leg that there's no feeling in. \nAnyhow - come on, Father. \nDid you hear anything? - About what? - About my whistle! Did you hear anything during confession? No! Now, come on! The confessional is sacrosanct. \nI have had that whistle for 40 years. \nIt saved my grandfather's life. \n- Did it really? - It did. \nHe was being executed by the British. \nThey had him up against a wall and they shot him. \nAnd the bullets hit the whistle in his pocket and bounced off him. \nGod Almighty! So he survived? No, no. \nThey just reloaded, shot him again. \nListen, Father, I don't want to be saying anything, but, erm Jim saw someone. \n- Yes? - He didn't get a good look, but he did notice something. \nThe collar. \nJim said it was a priest who stole the whistle. \nOh, right. \nThat'd be Ted. \n- What?! - You were talking about stealing and you showed me the whistle - you put it in your top pocket. \n(Ted) No, Dougal. \nNo, it is, Ted. \nTry your top pocket. \nI bet you it's in there. \nI'm sure it is. \nGive it a go. \nJust a bit more to your right, there. \nYes, Dougal. \nThank you. \nOh! Right! Yes. \nWell, there's an obvious explanation. \n- Is there, Father? - Yes, of course there is. \nWhat is it, Ted? I have to leave the room for a couple of minutes. \nWhen I return, I'll have a full explanation. \n- It had better be a good one. \n- It'll be perfectly satisfactory. \nExcuse me for a couple of minutes. \nSo, I hear your baby-sitter got pregnant. \nFather, more visitors. \n- Father Frost is here. \n- Get off! Right. \nI believe there's a Mr Benson who's had a whistle stolen. \n- That's me. \n- I have the culprit here. \n- What? - Yeah, I stole it. \nSo what? It's only a bleedin' whistle. \nI saw this eejit with a whistle on Tuesday. \nThen I heard Mr Benson's whistle had gone missing. \nThis eejit tried to put the blame on Father McGuire. \n- It was my fault for stealing it. \n- But you didn't steal it, Father. \nOh, right. \nHe hid it in a packet of cigarettes, apparently. \nThat must be how we got hold of it. \nFather Damien gave me the cigarettes to mind. \n(All) Ah! Right! I have a full explanation. \nFather I was just about to tell everybody why I stole the whistle. \nNo, Father I've been dying to get it off my chest. \n- Ted - 15 years ago, I met a young orphan. \nBoth his parents had been killed in a bizarre accident That's it - a tree fell on them. \nThis young man had nothing to his name except a dream. \n- Ted - Shut up. \nHis dream was to own his own stable, with prize-winning horses. \nBut he was afflicted by a disease that affected his speech. \nHe could only communicate by raising his eyebrows - once for yes, twice for n.\n\"If only I had a whistle \"so I could train my horses to win the Grand National,\" he thought. \nThat same boy wrote to me five weeks ago Father Damien took the whistle. \nOh, great. \nThat's that sorted out. \nSee you soon. \nWhat's all this about the horses? Nothing. \nI was just going mad. \nI have to say one of those masses. \n- When's tea ready? - No tea for you. \nGood. \nI don't want any stupid tea! Don't put too much faith in people who are \"cool\". \nThey're usually on the fast track to a life of crime. \nFather Lennon may have had a trendy haircut but he lacked that inner dignity of priesthood. \n- Drink! - With you in a moment. \nThe Church has no place for bad apples like Father Damien or the Bishop of Galway or that friend of Father Bigley's who was sending arms to Iraq. \nThe list goes on and on. \nWhat's important is that we're back to normal. \nYou're right there, Ted. \nSo, have you learned anything from your experience? No."

      "Ted, have you seen my record collection? - Record collection? - Yeah. \nHere it is. \nAnd Dougal, you need more than one record to have a collection. \nWhat YOU have is a record. \nOh, right. \nYeah. \n(Humming Nessun Dorma ) You know, you've a beautiful voice, Father. \nAh, no, I don't really. \nNo, you do. \nIt's gorgeous. \nWell, thanks very much. \nI don't think I've ever heard anything more beautiful in my life. \nSing something else. \nNow, I don't normally do requests. \nAh, go on, now. \nPlease! Ok. \n# I-I love Paris in the springtime # I love Paris in the fall # No. \nNo, I didn't like that one so much. \nI was a bit disappointed with that one. \n- Yes, thank you, Mrs Doyle. \n- That wasn't very good at all. \nYes I love that song, but that was catastrophic. \nI tell you what, Mrs Doyle, I won't book Carnegie Hall just yet. \nThey wouldn't let you play Carnegie Hall with a voice like that. \nCarnegie Hall. \nOh, here's one. \nHow do you get to Carnegie Hall? - Practice! - What? That old joke - \"How d'you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice!\" Uh? Oh, I-I see. \nUm, you'd have to go to New York, Dougal. \nOh, right. \nYeah. \nTed do you mind if I put on my record? No. \nGo ahead. \n- I've got Eurosong fever, Ted. \n- Yeah? God, yeah. \nI love the Eurosong competition. \nI can't wait. \n- What time is it now? - Half past one. \nAnd the competition is on in? May. \nYou know they're looking for entries for this year? - Are they? - Yeah. \n- Dougal - Why? - Dougal! - Ah, Ted - Dougal! - If we won, we'd be famous, like Nelson Mandela and his mad wife. \nNo, Dougal, we don't have the time. \nWe'd have to write a song. \nThat needs a person with special talent. \nCole Porter, George Gershwin, Chris de Burgh - (Phone ) - Not just any old eejit can take up songwriting just like that. \nHello. \nFather Ted Crilly. \n- Hello! Dick Byrne here. \n- Dick. \n- Are you entering this year? - 'What?' Eurosong '96. \nThe young fella has me driven mad with it. \nWe thought we'd enter. \nWhy don't you give it a go? - I'm sure you'd win. \n- Thanks If all the other contestants were killed! We'd do just as well as you would. \n- You wouldn't. \n- Yes, we would. \n- You wouldn't. \n- We would. \n- No, you wouldn't. \n- Yes, we would. \n- No, you wouldn't. \n- We would, we would, we would! - You wouldn't times a thousand! - Yes Jinx! No comebacks! Dougal, get the guitar. \n- I thought - I said get the guitar! Ok, right. \nWhat'll we write it about? How abouta lovely horse? Ok. \nWe'll call it My Lovely Horse by FatherTedCrilly. \nAnd, er, Father Dougal McGuire. \nAnd, erFatherDougalMcGuire. \nRight. \nHere we go. \nUm, will we do the lyrics first or will we do the music? Let's do the lyrics and fit the tune around it. \nRight. \nHere we go. \nMaybe we should do the music first. \nRight. \nHere we go. \nI like that. \n- Was that all right? - Yeah. \nIt was a bit sad. \nGood. \nGood. \nI'll write it down. \nI think it was an A minor. \nI-I think I think I have a lyric. \nRight. \nLyrics. \nGo ahead there, Dougal. \nWhat's it called again? My Lovely Horse. \nRight. \nHow about this? Er My lovely horse, I want to hold you so tight I want to rub my fingers through your tail andlove you all night. \nDougal Dougal, Dougal, stop there. \nkeep out of the whole area of being in love with the horse. \nOh, right. \nRight. \nWe're more friends with the horse. \nWe want to jump around and have a good laugh with it. \nRight. \nWhat about, Take this lump of sugar, baby, you know you want it? Something like those rap fellas would write. \nYou can forget about them, Dougal. \nYou can forget about Icy and Scoopy Scoopy Dog Dog. \nThey're no help to us now. \nWe're not moving until we've finished the song. \n- Ready? - Let's do it! Dougal, don't take it so seriously, it'sit's just a bit of fun. \nJust play the f---ing note! - The first one? - No, not the f---ing first one! That's already f---ing down! Play the f---ing note you were f---ing playing. \nI'm playing the f---ing first one! We have the f---ing first one! (Can rattles) So I Play the f---ing note you were f---ing playing! The thing you were just doing! Play the f---ing note! (Disco beat on keyboard) Right. \n(Disco beat) (Monotone ) # My lovely horse running through thefield # Where are you going # With your fetlocks blowing in thewind? # I want to shower you with sugar lumps # And ride you overfences # I want to polish your hooves every single day # And bring you to the horsedentist # My lovely horse you're a pony no # More # Running around with a man on your back # Like a train in the night # Wait, I can do this bit. \n# Like a train in thenight # Well, er, what do you think in general? Right. \nFather Jack's right. \nIt's a terrible song. \nWhat were we thinking? It's not that bad, Ted. \nThe lyrics are fine. \nThere's no problem there. \nBut it's a terrible tune. \nIt's just the same note over and over again. \nI'll put on my favourite Eurosong, maybe that'll cheer us up. \nYes, that might help. \nWhat is it? It's Nin Huugen and the Huugen Notes. \nIt came fifth in A Song For Norway in 1976. \n(Music starts) (Lively tune with Norwegian lyrics) That's not too bad, actually. \nThat's the B-side. \nI'll turn it over. \n- No. \nNo, leave it. \nLeave it. \n- It's nice enough, isn't it? Yeah. \nIf only we'd come up with something like that. \nDougalI suppose not many people have actually heard that song? Suppose not. \nFirst time I've heard it. \nWhere are the band now? Oh, God, Ted, it's a terrible story. \nThey all died in a plane crash, including everybody involved in the song - the studio engineers, the producer, the manager - The people who owned the rights? - Oh, yes. \nThat's terrible. \n- Er, Dougal - Yeah? Wouldn't it be nice to commemorate those people - by keeping their music alive? - What? Suppose we were to borrow that tune for My Lovely Horse. \nIt would help us out and commemorate their memory at the same time. \nSo we wouldn't just be stealing their tune? No! You'd have to be mad to jump to that conclusion. \nAs I say, we'd just be celebrating their memory. \nSecretly. \n- Incidentally, don't tell anyone. \n- Oh, right. \nAnd if the song wins and we make any money, we could give it to their relatives. \nYeah We'll play that by ear. \n(Ted humming Huugen Notes tune ) You know, I don't want to jump to any conclusions but I think we're definitely going to win! Really? Oh, great. \nThere'll be lots to think about. \nPromotions for journalists, American tour dates And I suppose a big fly poster campaign. \n- And the obligatory video. \n- Obligatory video - wow! Are priests allowed to be rock stars, though, Ted? A lad at the seminary, Father Benny Cake, he recorded a song that went to number one in England. \n- Really? - Yeah. \nHe didn't want to be known as a priest so he called himself Anyway, the song was called Vienna. \nWhy didn't he want people to know he was a priest? People thought if you were a priest, you were uncool. \n- A bit of a square. \n- Then we came along. \nYeah. \nAnyway, Dougal, get to sleep. \nSweet dreams. \n# My lovely, lovely, lovely horse # My lovely horse # (My lovely horse ) # Running through the field # Where are you going # With your fetlocks blowing in the wind? # I want to shower you with sugar lumps # And ride you over fences # Polish your hooves every single day # And bring you to the horse dentist # My lovely, lovely, lovely horse # My lovely horse # (My lovely horse ) # You're a pony no more # Running around with a man on your back # Like a train in the night, yeah # Like a train in the night # (Saxophone solo ) (Ted panting) We have to lose that sax solo! Er, Mrs Doyle, I think that's enough make-up on Dougal now. \nThere you go. \nGood man. \n(knock at door) Hello, uh, Father Crilly. \nI'm Charles Hedges, your producer, and this is Mr Rickwood! I'm delighted to meet you. \nYou did a brilliant job last year. \nThat's the business, you know, in and out of doors, like, and giddy up! S-sorry? The business, and giddy up! Ah, yes! Ha ha! (Gibberish) Mm. \nMm. \nMm. \nI have to say, he sounded a lot better on last year's show. \nOnce he's on stage, he's fine. \n- Have you known him long? - Yes. \nPartners for ten years. \nRunning the production company? No, no. \nHe's my lover. \nHe He's quite a catch. \nThis is my partner, Father Dougal McGuire. \nNot my sexual partner! My partner I do the song with. \n- Yes, well, I'd guessed that. \n- Of course. \nNot that there's anything wrong with that type ofthing. \nI thought the Church thought it was inherently wrong. \nAh, yes, it does. \nThe whole gay thing - I suppose it's a bit of a puzzle to us all. \nIt must be fun, though. \nNot the Not the, you know, but the nightclubs and the whole rough and tumble of homosexual activity. \nHaving boyfriends when you're a man. \nDon't mind what the Church thinks, it thought the earth was flat! Sometimes the Pope says things he doesn't mean. \nEven the Pope gets things wrong. \nWhat about Papal infallibility? Yes. \nIs it for everything, the infallibility? I don't know. \nRight. \nAnyhow Nothing to do with me! I'm really looking forward to your entry. \nThe song! Ha! The song. \nRight. \n- Well, so am I. \n- Do you think we'll win? It's not up to him. \nIt's the public who decide. \n- Not this year. \n- No? This year, I'll pick the winner. \nThat old phone-in system wasn't working. \nBut the song the public chose has won five years in a row. \nYes, but it's, eh quite complicated. \nAre you looking forward to the show? Oh, yes. \nWe're all thrilled. \nBit of a novelty, I suppose, what with us being priests. \nAh, well, not exactly. \nThere's a similar act to yours. \nFather Byrne and Father McDuff. \nI didn't think they'd make it this far. \nFlip! They'll win, Ted. \nWe might as well give up now. \nThat's a very defeatist attitude! Oh, it is. \nSorry about that. \nAh, but he's right, Ted. \nReady to be beaten, then? I'd say your song is terrible anyway. \nIt's better than yours, ya big fool! Take that back! I'll just be leaving. \nThanks, Charles. \nSee you later. \nYes, thanks. \nWe'll have a great time. \nI bet we get a million points and you get minus 7,000! - How much do you bet?! - Four pounds! Right! You're on! That's just us winning. \nA million points is a bit of an exaggeration. \nRight, we're off to win the contest. \nAh, seriously, Ted Even if you don't win, I'm sure your song's very good. \n- Really? - No! Oh, I really hate Father Dick Byrne! - Good luck tonight, Fred. \n- (Incomprehensible mumbling) (Theme music) Thanks. \nRight, let's go. \n'And now, live from the Theatre Royal, A Song For Ireland. \n'And here's your host, Fred Rickwood. \n' Hello! What a pro. \nAnd welcome to Song For Ireland. \nThe contest where we select your representative to sing for Ireland. \n'This year we've got a lot of new acts from all around the country' Huh! Look at Dick Byrne over there, showing off! He won't be too happy when we win and he comes last! . \n. \ncome a long way and I know they're eager to start. \nSo please put your hands together and welcome on stage Euro hopefuls from Rugged Island, Father Dick Byrne and Father Cyril McDuff! (Organ introduction ) # When I was young # I had a dream # And though the dream was very small # It wouldn't leave me # (Dougal, Dougal!) # To play the poet or the fool # And now you see me (Choir joins in ) # And now # The miracle is mine # Oh, and the war begun # And I # I'm goin' for a fag! (Whistling cheerfully) (Huugen Notes song playing in lift) Oh, God! - Dougal, we can't do the song! - What's up, Ted? I just heard it in the lift! I heard someone whistling it! Shows what a great song it is. \nNo! They'll know we ripped it off! It's more famous than we thought! Oh, we'll be found out! What'll we do, Ted? What did we do to deserve this?! # I # I've nothing left but time # Still I reach out # Song's nearly over. \nOh, no! I thinkDougal We'll have to resort to Plan B. \n# Ahhh # Wonderful! Wonderful! Something else! And now on to our next act. \nAll the way from Craggy Island, could you please welcome Father Ted Crilly and Father Dougal McGuire! (Applause ) (Monotone ) # My lovely horse running through the # Field # Where are you going # With your fetlocks blowing in the # Wind # I want to shower you with sugar lumps # And ride you over # Fences # And polish your hooves every single day # And send you to the horse # Dentist # My lovely horse you're a pony no # More # Running around with a man on your back # Like a train in the night, Like a train in the # I can get this. \n# Night # (Silence ) (Laughter) Well, we did it! Don't ask me how, but we did it! It's simple, Father - yours was the best song. \nI suppose so. \nBut I didn't think the audience were going for it. \n(Gibberish) Yeah, yeah Cheers! What's going on?! Our song was clearly miles better! Well, we thought It was the same note over and over again! Yes, but we admired its erm (Gibberish) Exactly! Fred put it better than I ever could. \nSo there! You'd think you wanted Ireland to lose the Euro contest! (Laughs) (Nervous laughter) Nonsense! Why would we want to do that?! Maybe because it was costing you too much to stage(!) Oh-oh-ho, dear, dear, dear! Now, come on! Does that really sound plausible? Go and count your sour grapes beforethey hatch. \nBetter luck next time! - We lost, Cyril! - Really? Come on! Anyway, Father, I'm sure you'll do very well at the Eurosong Contest. \nI think we will. \nEurope, here we come! We'd better sneak them out the back. \nThat's a nasty crowd out there. \n'Thank you, Athens. \nThat's a total of 103 for Belgium. \n'Now, could we have the points for Ireland's entry, My Lovely Horse. \n' 'Irelande, nil points. \n' 'Ireland, no points. \n' 'Irlanda, nada. \n' 'Ireland, no points. \n' 'Irlandia, meethen vathmee. \n' 'Ireland, no points. \n' 'Irlande, keine punte. \n' 'Ireland, no points. \n' 'Irshka, bash bodova. \n' 'Again, Ireland - no points. \n' 'Irlandia, nurda proken. \n' 'Ireland, n-nothing there again. \n' 'Irlande, nil punten. \n' 'Ireland, no points. \n' 'Irlinia, nurda purda. \n' 'That means nothing. \n' 'Irlenski, nurte point lete. \n' 'Nothing."

      "Ted! Ted, quick! It's Father Ben! Oh, great. \nI love this. \n'God, Ben, I'm such an eejit. \n'I've put the shorts on me head!' 'God Almighty, Brendan. \nYou're a big fool. \n' This isthis is really top-notch stuff. \nThat Brendan's an eejit. \nI know someone just like Ben. \nBig thicko! (Helicopter) (Crash) (Man ) Come on, you two. \nNearly there. \n(Woman ) It's a bit creepy. \n(Man ) There's nothing that could harm (Twig snaps ) Ah. \nThere he is now, anyway. \n- He's great, isn't he? - He is. \n- Does he have a name? - The pet shop didn't mention one. \nI dunno How about \"Ted\"? That's a good name for a rabbit. \nThat's not a good idea. \nYou're forgetting I'm called Ted. \nI could call you Father Ted. \nNo. \nYou'll have to come up with something a bit more original. \n- Hello, Fathers. \n- (Both) Hello, Mrs Doyle. \nHow about \"Mrs Doyle\"? Mrs Doyle is not a good name for a rabbit. \nSomething like \"Popsy\" or \"Bruce\". \nOh, right. \nWait, I've got one. \nYou see the way he's got big, floppy ears? Yeah. \nWhy don't we call him \"Father Jack Hackett\"? Perfect. \nFather Jack it is. \n- What?! - Nothing. \nDougal's named his rabbit. \n- What?! - You all right, Father Jack? - What?! - No. \nHe's talking to the rabbit. \n- What?! - Father Jack wants a drink. \nDrink! Drink! - Give him some water. \n- Water! Feck! Dougal, this is getting far too confusing. \nI'm used to calling him Father Jack. \nCall Father Jack something else. \nGreat. \nWhat'll we call him? Flipper. \nFlipper the Priest. \nYes? - Dougal, this is not going to work. \n- (Phone ) - 'Father Crilly speaking. \n' - Crilly, it's Bishop Brennan. \nOh, feck! What? (French accent) Who is this? There is no Crilly 'ere. \nGod, I just said \"feck\" to Bishop Brennan. \nHe won't like that. \nIt's Ok, I put on an accent so he'll think he had the wrong number. \n(Phone ) - 'Crilly. \n' - Hello, Bishop Brennan. \nI think you got the wrong number there. \nShut up, Crilly. \nShut up. \nI'll make this quick. \nWhat would the following words suggest to you? \"Jack\", \"sleepwalking\" and \"bollock-naked\"? Oh, no! This is the third time in the last six months. \nYou may have heard of Brian Noonan, a very important Junior Minister, and a personal friend. \nAnd the last thing he and his family needs to see is the vision of an elderly priest wearing only socks and a hat. \nI'll be round on Thursday to examine security arrangements. \n- And Crilly? - Yes? If you ever try to bullshit me like that again, I will rip off your arms. \nBishop Brennan's coming to have a word, Father, - about your nude sleepwalking. \n- Nudie Father Jack! Can you think why you might be doing that? You're not having any doubts about your vocation? - What?! - You can share problems with us. \nWe'll always listen. \nRight, Dougal? Absolutely. \nD'you want to talk about it now? Well, Ted - Byker Grove. \nGod, yes. \nAfter Byker Grove. \nGo on, there. \nGo on, boy. \nFetch! Go on. \nGo on. \nCome on, don't let Bishop Brennan see him. \n- He might like him. \n- No, he doesn't like rabbits. \n- Why not? - It's a strange story. \nTen years ago he got trapped in a lift with 20 rabbits. \nThey started nibbling his cape. \nHow did they get in? They must've burrowed in. \nYou know rabbits. \n- God, he can move fast enough. \n- Why d'you say that? He just shot across the floor. \nWait That's your rabbit. \n- Yeah. \n- Where did this one come from? There's another one on Jack's head. \nMake sure your rabbit doesn't get mixed up with these. \n- Come on, Sampras. \n- What did you call him? Sampra.\nLike Pete Sampras. \nWhy? You know - rabbits, tennis - that whole connection. \nOh, right. \nWe'll just release these spare ones into the wild, Ok? Look at him without any other rabbits for company. \nHe must feel like Brian k eenan after they took John McCarthy away. \nAnyway, he'll get used to it. \nMorning, Father. \nBills, bills, more bills. \n- Morning, Ted. \n- Morning, Dougal. \nWhat'll we do today? Hide your rabbit before Bishop Brennan comes. \nHe'd go mad if he thought there's rabbit around. \n- Fair enough. \n- I hope he's in a good mood. \nLen can be very scary when When (Screams ) - What's wrong, Ted? - Rabbits! Rabbits? Where? Oh, wow! (Ted) Where did these ones come from? God, it's like a big rabbit rock festival. \nI suppose we'll just have to get used to it. \n\"Get used to it?\" We have to get them out of here! - I'll ring the shop. \n- No, it was a travelling pet shop. \nThey won't be back till spring. \nGod! What are we gonna do? There is actually something we can do, Ted. \nIf we Let me see now. \nJust wait a second. \n- I know. \nI've got it. \n- What? Now, the way I see it is if we Wait a second. \nWhat's the problem again? - The rabbits! - Rabbits, yes. \nSorry about that. \nI know exactly what to do. \nGive them to Father Larry Duff. \nRight! He's always going on about how he'd love to have a few rabbits! I used to think it was just a mad thing to say. \n(Ringing) - 'Hello, Larry?' - Hello, Ted. \nHow's it hangin'? It's hanging fine. \nI've a bit of a problem. \nRemember you were looking for a few rabbits? I do, Ted. \nThat's one of my all-time fantasies. \nI'd love to have a few hundred rabbits running all over the place. \nWell, today's your lucky day. \nWe've got loads of the things! Sorry, Ted. \nI won't be able to take them. \n- Why not, Larry? - I gave up on the rabbits idea. \nIt just seemed too far-fetched. \nSo I got 12 Rottweilers instead. \nI'd love to take the rabbits only I'd be afraid the Rottweilers might upset them. \n- Yes, Larry. \nI understand. \nBye. \n- Ah, bye, Ted. \nOh, you're a bad dog. \nDon't you look at me like that. \n- (Growling and snarling) - You're a very bad dog. \n(Snarling and barking) He can't take the rabbits. \nHe's got 12 Rottweilers. \n- Hey! Hey! Hey, you! - Yes, Father? (Stuttering) Rats! Yes, Father, we can see them as well. \nHairy Japanese bastards! D'you know what this is like? A plague, a big rabbit plague. \nI wonder if God is punishing us. \nMaybe because I said \"feck\" to Bishop Brennan. \nIf he'd send a plague of rabbits for that, what'll he do about that money you stole from that charity? Dougal, that money was just resting in my account before I moved it on! - Ted - It was a non-profit making Ted! The bunnies are gone! - Where did they go? - I think they followed Father Jack. \nAmazing. \nI always thought Father Jack gave off a furry smell. \nMaybe they think he's a rabbit god. \nSo if we keep Jack out of the way But Bishop Brennan's coming to see Jack. \nWe'll have to get rid of them. \nYou know Paddy Jordan, works at the greyhound track? - Oh, yes. \n- Get me his number. \nI've an idea. \n(Buzzer) (Banging) Come on! Get out of it! Shoo! Shoo! Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer the greyhounds-pursuing-rabbits approach. \nIt was just a thought. \nI'll go and give Tom a call. \n- He might be able to help. \n- Coming, Father? No. \nI've 10 riding on that little beauty. \nCome on, Eamonn! Come on, Eamonn! Come on, Eamonn! (Buzzer) - 'Who's that? Go away!' - Ah, Tom, it's just us. \n'Right, Father. \nCome on down. \n' Tom knows about this type of thing. \nHe'll help us. \n- Hello, Fathers. \n- Hello, Tom. \n- Something to eat? A salad? - No, thanks. \nSome other time. \nYou've a few rabbits for me? - Yes, in the car. \n- With you in a moment. \nWhat's Tom going to do again? He just said he'd take care of them. \nProbably collect them together somewhere safe. \n- So he'll just look after them? - (Clattering) I think he'll put them in a pen where they can play. \n(Chainsaw roaring) . \n. \nso there'll be nothing to worry about. \n(Dougal) That puts my mind to rest. \n- There he is. \n- Right, Father. \nLet's get to it. \nThat's an impressive sword. \nWhere will you put the rabbits? - In the vice, Father. \n- In the vice? I've been practising with this toy one. \nFirst you stun it, right? Then you put it in the vice. \nGrab his legs there, Father. \nEr, Tom, you know the phrase \"to take care of something\"? Yes, Father. \nI realise now that you meant that in a sort of Al Pacino way whereas I was thinking more along the lines of Julie Andrews. \nThey won't feel a thing. \n- No. \n- You can have a go if you want. \nNo, no, Tom. \nIt's a bit cruel. \nI could run 'em down in me van. \n- Dougal, we'd better be off. \n- What's the problem, Ted? Have you nothing I can kill? Sorry about that, Tom. \nAh, feck it! Feck it anyway! (Ted) Run, Dougal. \nRun quite fast! (Ted) I'm sure it won't happen again. \n(Brennan ) It better not. \nPriests walking about in the nude is the last thing that we need. \n(Giggles ) Yes. \nAnd as you can see, we've installed a new closed-circuit camera. \nAnd added a few modifications to Jack's bed. \nAh, yes. \nYes. \nNow, this is new, isn't it? Combined with the spikes, escape is almost impossible. \nAnd new pyjamas - very easy to put on, very hard to get off so that's the nudity sorted. \nAnd, eh, you have the Ah, yes. \nThe rope. \n(Chuckles ) I'd like to see him chew through that. \nAgain. \nIn the event of him getting out, we have this tracking device. \nThat cost 50. \nCould we get that back from the diocese? Just joking! - Ah, hello, Len. \n- Don't call me Len. \nI'm a bishop. \n- \"Your Grace\" is more appropriate. \n- Oh, right. \nHello. \nAnyway Yet again, I am dragged away from my warm fireside to come and deal with the cast of Police Academy. \nYou behave yourself now, Jack. \nYou listening, Jack? No! - Drink, your Grace? - A small one, please. \nI'll just Would you like ice with it? A drop of soda? I'll just get the glasses. \n- (Jack) Feck off! - (Punch) - A cup of tea, your Grace? - Time for dinny-poos! Thanks very much, Mrs Doyle. \nThat'll be grand. \nMm! Oh, there you are, Bishop Brennan. \nI thought I should tell you, your car is parked outside. \nI know it is. \nI parked it myself. \nThe tyres look a bit flat. \nI could blow them up with the pump. \n- No! - What kind of air do you put in? We've got ordinary or That's all we have. \nIf you're looking for the wipers, they're in the kitchen. \nWhat? They looked like they needed a wash. \nOnly trouble is, I broke the side window while I was snapping them off. \nLeave my car alone and don't touch it again. \nJust one question, your Grace. \n- Is your car diesel or petrol? - Leave it alone, Mrs Doyle. \nNo, no, no. \nThis is just curiosity, your Grace. \n- Diesel or? - Diesel! It's diesel! - So it's not petrol. \n- No, it's not petrol. \nIt'd do terrible damage if I put petrol in? Yes. \nIt would completely ruin the car's engine. \nWell (Laughs hysterically) I certainly won't do that, then! You must clock up a fair old mileage, going round the diocese, doing the old bishop sort of Crilly, Crilly, where is my room? Well, er, yours is the spare room, your Grace. \nIt's the first on the right. \nEr This lettuce No, thanks. \nI've already had some. \nYou take it. \nNo, Crilly. \nCrilly, I mean this lettuce - where did it come from? You don't have rabbits, do you? No! God, no! I don't like them at all. \nI had an experience once with some. \nThey got into a lift with me and started to nibble my cape You've absolutely nothing to worry about, your Grace. \nThat's just where we, um where we growthe lettuce. \nYou-you grow lettuce indoorsin a cage? Yes, it's safer, you know. \nNo one can steal it and, uh Well, you know, it brightens up the room. \nUh-huh. \nHmm. \nEr Crilly, what is this? That's, um caviar. \nCaviar? It's not every day we have a bishop round so we thought we'd get the caviar out. \nRight, so you've spread caviar down there so I can get down on my knees and eat off the floor?! Yes. \nWhat d'you think I am, a pony? I'm going to my bed. \n- Where are they? - The bunnies? Ah-ha. \nSomewhere really safe, Ted. \nGod - Where would that be? - Guess. \nIt's almost the type of place you wouldn't even think of. \nGod, II dunno. \nThat small room behind the kitchen? The coal cellar? - I've got it. \nThe shed! - No, it's not the shed. \nCome on, where's the last place you'd think I'd put them? The last place I'd think you'd put them would be W-would actually be - Bishop Brennan's room. \n- Bingo! Think about it, it's the last place he'd expect to find them! His room! He'd never look there! Your Grace! Your Grace! - Your Grace, Your Grace! - What is it now?! I just wanted to say, the whole bishop thing, fair play to ya! You probably get a lot of this, but well done. \nWho'd have thought somebody from Limerick would get this far? The other priests from the seminary must feel pretty sick. \nThey must be looking at the TV and going, \"How did that awful eejit get to be a bishop?!\" Not me, I always felt you have a sort of a bishopy air about you. \nI'd just like to say - can I shake your hand? - well done! Crilly, come here. \nI hate you. \nSo all that means absolutely nothing to me. \nOh, I'm falling down the stairs! (Yells) Crilly, what happened?! (Ted) I just fell down the stairs there. \nAre you injured? I don't know My arm I can't move Do you want somebody to call an ambulance? No, I'll just lie here for a while. \nRest is probably the best thing for me, now. \nDid you see that documentary about Hiroshima? Who'd think an atomic bomb could do so much damage? I'm going to bed! I'm all right, Bishop. \nI'm fine now, thanks. \nPhew! (Dougal) Ted, did Len find the rabbits? What did he say? I better tell you Did he call me Len again?! You address me by my proper title, you little bollocks! (Dougal) Sorry, Bishop Len Brennan. \n- What is he on about now? - God knows. \nWhat are ye on about, you big eejit? - Did he find the rabbits? - Shut up, Dougal! Your Grace, your Grace! May I go in first? - Why? - All the other toilets are broken. \n- Oh, it's just number ones. \n- I don't want to know! Oh, I needed that. \nBut there's no toilet in here! Dougal, they're not in there! - Are they not? - No, that is a rabbit-free area. \nI definitely put them in there. \nJack's room. \nMaybe they smelled him and had to see him one last time. \nYou might be putting that in an over-romantic way, but come on! God, Dougal, you're right. \nBut how did they get in? They must have burrowed in. \nYou know rabbits. \nWe've got to get them out and as far away as possible! Why not leave them here? I can't relax till the only rabbit left is the one sitting in your head working the controls! God, Ted, there's loads more in here. \nLook at this one! Doesn't he look like that fella, Harvey k eitel? God, Dougal, how could a rabbit look like God Almighty! It's the spitting image of him! (Ted) Anyway, we haven't time for things like that. \n(Dougal) Go on, lads, go on. \nIn, in (Jack breathing heavily) Ted, the bunnies are gone. \nOh, God! Where's Jack?! Oh, my God! Not the Bishop's room! Come on, Dougal! - (Dougal, get as many as you can. \n) - (All right. \nCome on, lads. \n) - (Ted) Mind that one. \n- (Brennan muttering) Just a bad dream, your Grace. \nOver in a mo. \nOh, right. \n(Screaming)"

      "Rock a Hula Ted\n(Woman on TV) 'Societies in ancient India were ruled by women. \n' 'Really?' 'And men weren't allowed around women without a licence. \n'They were told off for being sexist. \n' 'Anyway, you're going to do a song from your new album. \n' God, what an eejit. \nShe's never happy unless she's complaining. \nOh, you're right there, Ted. \n'I believe this new song is about the Catholic Church?' Here she goes. \n'It's about how the Church in Ireland 'secretly had lots of potatoes during the famine, 'and hid them in pillows and sold them abroad at potato fairs. \n' - 'Really. \n' - 'The Pope closed the factories 'making the potatoes and turned them into prisons for children. \n' God Almighty! She says that as if it was sinister! What is the problem with her?! She seems to be taking the whole Catholic thing a bit seriously. \n- Yes, Dougal. \n- It's just a bit of a laugh. \nStop talking, Dougal. \nAnyway, this whole radical feminism really gets my goat. \nMad! This idea that the Catholic Church has a negative attitude to women. \nHere's her song. \n# Big men in frocks # Tellin' us what to do # They can't get pregnant # Like I do # Mrs Doyle, you're a woman. \nWhat do you make of this? - Is the Catholic Church sexist? - Oh, God, no, Father. \nI've always found the Church very responsive to my views. \nOne time I was having terrible troubles at home and the Church gave me great support. \nA lot of people like to run the Church down, but they're just a load of old moaners - moan, moan, moan! So thanks for asking, Father, but no. \nNo, I have no complaints at all. \nYeah, great. \n# You give us all your rules # But that's not the way it was # Women ruled the land of (Indecipherable ) - (Alarm ) - Oh, no! (Jack) Drink! God, he goes mad if I'm a second late with his drink. \nFather Jack, your afternoon drink. \nYou know, you should really get a haircut. \nDon't go too far down that Bob Geldof road. \n- God, Ted, that's a bad road. \n- It is indeed, Dougal. \nAnd there's no coming back. \nAs Bob himself will tell you. \n(Laughing) Oh! What did you pay for the shelves, Ted? I don't really remember, Liam. \nThese won't last you. \nLook, you could talk that into coming down. \nWell, they've lasted fine until now. \nGive us a go. \nOh, God, Ted, I can feel it beginning to give. \nAh, look at that, Ted. \nSure, it's falling apart! - How about a little cup of tea? - Fair enough. \nSo, erm - What did you want to talk about? - Oh, yes. \nNow You were going to the Lovely Girls Festival this year, right? I never miss the Lovely Girls Festival. \nMy absolute favourite time of year. \nHow is Miss Lovely Girl 1995 doing? Ted, we had to strip her of her title. \nOh, God. \nWhy? We found out she'd been in a film called Stallion Farm. \nI heard it was a bit rude. \nAnyway, I'm chairman of the organising committee this year, and I was wondering if you wanted to judge it. \nJudge it? Oh, God, Liam, I'd love to. \nAnd there's the dinner afterwards. \nOh, yes. \nYou have the honour of taking the winner out for a meal. \nAnd who pays for it? It's not me, did I hear that somewhere? Yes, that's right. \nWe brought that in a few years ago. \nYou get to take her out for a meal, - she gets to pay for it. \n- Lovely. \nHow much did that stereo set you back, Ted? About 100. \nI could've got you a great one for half that. \nCareful, Liam. \nAnyway, you were saying? - (Clanking) - Oh, yes. \nNow, when you take the Lovely Girl out to dinner, could you persuade her to wear one of me mammy's dresses? - She could use the publicity. \n- Right. \n- How's the business going? - Great! She sold one last week. \nHow many is that sold this year? That'd be one. \nYou see? Anyway Basically, you see we thought it'd be a laugh getting a priest to judge it. \nAlso, it eliminates any sexual aspect to the thing. \nOr am I wrong, huh? I hope you won't be tempted by all those Lovely Girls. \nThere's no chance of that, Liam. \nCos we've had problems with that sort of thing before. \nNo, no, Ted. \nWe really have had problems. \nRight. \nYou don't have to worry there, Liam. \nRight. \nI'll be off. \nGoodbye, Liam. \nHow much did you pay for the door, Ted? I don't know. \nIt came with the house. \nCowboys, Ted! They're a bunch of cowboys! Oh, God. \nThere she is again. \nShe's all over the place. \n\"Clit power\"? What does that mean? Don't know. \nI knew a Father Clint Power. \nMaybe she's having a go at him. \n- What's the interview like? - I didn't read much of it. \nShe's going around the countr.\nShe wants to buy a house on an island, some godforsaken place off the west coas.\nReally? Did it mention what island she had her eye on? Craggy Island, yeah. \nCraggy Island's the place for me. \n'I see it as being a safe haven 'for those who wish to escape the hypocrisy of the mainland. \n' Oh, God. \n'I want a world free of sexual and religious intolerance. \n' No, no, no. \nThat's terrible news. \nRight. \nWe just have to stand our ground. \nI'm bound to bump into her. \nThe people here won't stand for a world free of sexual and religious intolerance. \nNo way, Jose. \nRight, Father. \nThe roof should be Ok now. \nI hoovered the upstairs and I did the attic, top to bottom. \nWhat else? Oh, yes, yes. \nI washed your car. \nAlso, I built a greenhouse beside the garage. \nWill that be all for today? Oh, Mrs Doyle. \nAny chance of a cup of tea for your two favourite priests? (Whistling) God, Ted, it's only 11. \nWhat are you doing up? I want to get away early to the Lovely Girls competition. \nI wouldn't know what to say to a Lovely Girl. \nThere's no end of things you can talk about. \nWhat their father does, if they have a boyfriend, dresses, anything to do with clothes and perfume. \nClothes is easiest because men don't wear perfume. \n- Except Father Bigley. \n- Except Father Bigley. \nAnyway, if you ever meet a woman I'm sure you'll deal with it. \nJust be yourself, make them feel at ease, and the golden rule - always let them have their way. \nIt's easiest in the long run. \nI'm off. \nI don't want to keep those Lovely Girls waiting. \nOk, right. \n\"Beyourself\" (Chattering) How are you, how are you doing? (Chuckling) She's coming for you, Billy! She's got her eye on Paddy. \nLads, how's it going? We're getting the eye from all the girls. \nI hope you don't get into any mischief. \n- You know us, Father. \n- I do, and that's the trouble. \nLads, I have to go, the competition starts any second. \nNow, Father, that's not on, impersonating Sir Bob. \nWhat would the other Live Aid people think? Peter Gabriel and Queen and all the other bands? Phil Collins flew all the way to Boston! - Ooh! - Feck off! Shoddy workmanship, that's what it is! Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy! Ted, for crying out loud, will you get up there? The girls won't stay lovely forever, you know. \nSorry. \nFather Jack just punched me in the stomach. \nGod! (Gasping) Hello, Lovely Girls. \nLook at them there (Ted breathing heavily) . \n. \nwalking around. \n(Gasping) Ohh. \nOhh. \n(Ted groaning) Ohohhh. \n(Doorbell) Mrs Doyle? Someone at the door, Mrs Doyle. \n(Doorbell) Mrs Doyle! (Woman ) Hello there. \nWell, Imelda, you're a lovely girl. \nI hear you had a bit of bad luck. \nYour dog was knocked down by a car and killed. \nNo, that wasthat was my father. \nIt says here that you're 22. \nRight. \nYou were born in Mayo, that's a lovely part of the world. \n- Dundalk. \n- Dundalk, yeah. \nAnd it says here that you're a black belt in karate. \nSo what if I did that?! - (Screams ) - Imelda! Tell you what. \nYou look through my notes and stop at any information that's actually true. \nI will indeed, Father. \nYou haven't told me your name yet, Father. \nErm \"Be yourself. \n\" Right. \nFather Dougal McGuire. \nOh, right. \nThis is a great house. \nI love the crude religious imagery. \nYes, I like it. \nAre you all right there? - How's your bra? - What?! Your bra. \nIs it comfortable? Do you have a bra? What are you saying? It's not too tight, is it? Cos you can loosen it if you want. \nTake it off, sure, go on. \nOr would you like some tea? I tell you what. \nI'll make the tea, you take your bra off. \nOh, right. \nIsn't that Bob Geldof there? No, is it? Wait a second. \nIt is. \nHe's looking a bit rough. \nHe lost all his money in that Live Aid thing. \nI'm not sure if it is Bob Geldof. \nHang on there a second. \n- Excuse me, are you? - (Jack) Feck off! It's himself, all right. \nAnd now, walkin.\nLook at them there, walking around. \nLook out there, Mary. \nDoesn't Mary have a lovely bottom? Careful there, Ted. \nThat might offend the girls. \nRight, Liam. \nOf course, they all have lovely bottoms. \nActually, Mrs Doyle makes the tea, and she's out. \nWhy don't you just make the tea? But Mrs Doyle makes the tea. \nAnyway, I'd better just tell you why I'm here. \nI'm looking for a house in the area and I really, really like this one. \nI'm sorry. \nYour sandwich exceeds the required 6cm in width, so it's between Imelda and Mary in the Lovely Laugh tie-break. \nIn order to hear your lovely laugh, I'll tell you a joke. \nSo here we go. \nThis is my Robin Williams impression. \nThis is the joke. \nSecretary: \"Sir, the Invisible Man is in reception. \n\" Got that? Boss: \"Tell him I can't see him. \n\" I think I have to say Imelda's laugh is nicer. \nI'm sorry, Mary. \nThat means Imelda is the winner! ( # Organ fanfare ) And there's your Certificate of Loveliness and you'll be going to dinner in Craggy Island's top seafood restaurant, the Thai Cottage. \n- Who will you be inviting? - My mother. \nJust have another go. \nSorry. \nI'll be inviting you, Father. \nYes, you will! And you'll be paying. \nIt's not me who pays. \nSo there she is, the winner of our Lovely Girl 1996, Imelda! There you are. \nHow did the Lovely Girls competition go? Brilliantly well. \nAnd I get a free dinner tomorrow night. \n- Great. \nIs Jack with you? - Oh, God. \nJack. \nWow. \nYou really knocked Michael Hutchence unconscious? I battered him! - Anyway, anything happen? - No. \nCan't think of anything. \nOh, one Niamh Connolly called. \nNiamh Connolly? What did you say to her? Oh, don't worry, Ted. \nIt was fine. \nI took your advice and it was grand. \n- She's upstairs now. \n- She's still here? Yeah. \nI think she's in the toilet. \nOh. \nHello again. \nI was just telling Ted you were in the toilet. \n- Hello. \n- Hello there. \nFather Ted Crilly. \nYou must be Miss Connolly. \nI suppose that's sexist now, to call a young lady \"Miss\". \nIt's too late for me to change. \nYou can't teach an old dog new tricks. \nWell, it's getting kinda late. \nOh, right. \nI won't keep you. \n- Bye, so. \n- Bye. \n- Goodbye, Father. \n- Yes, goodbye. \nOh, Ted, that's the other thing. \nI sold Niamh the house. \nWhat?! Actually, I just gave it to her. \nWhat?! You Wait a minute! She's gonna make it a studio. \nWe can have all the recording time we want. \nWait, now. \nWait, now! You gave her the house?! How Wait! Where are we going to live? Miss Connolly, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. \nLook, I have to record a duet over the phone with Peter Gabriel. \nI hope you don't mind, but Nigel and Tony will show you out. \nI'm sorry but we're not going anywhere. \n- Oh? - (Ted) Right. \nI'm not staying here to be insulted by you. \nI wouldn't stay in this house if you gave me a million pounds! Wait a minute. \nI meant to say, \"Please give us back the house. \n\" What did I say? Why are we outside? Ted, where are we going to live? (Thunder and pouring rain ) God, Dougal. \nI go away for a few hours and you give away the house. \nTell me again. \nWhat exactly happened? I was sticking to your rules. \nNumber one - \"Be yourself. \n\" No, no, no, no, no. \n\"Be yourself\" is just something people say. \nNever be yourself with women. \nNever, never, never! - What then? - I made her more comfortable. \n- Like you said. \n- Yes. \nSo I asked her to take off her bra. \nWe'll come back to that one. \n- But you gave away the house. \n- What about the golden rule? - \"Give them what they want. \n\" - No. \nThat's the silver rule. \nThe golden rule is, \"Think about what you're saying, then don't say it. \n\"And then just run away somewhere. \n\" Right? All right. \nThis is a long shot, but it's our only hope. \nI'm going to leave this paper and pencil here. \nHopefully in the morning, God will have written down what we should do. \nThat is a long shot. \nIt's our only hope, Dougal. \nCome on, God. \nTed! Ted! What is it? Did God write back? No, He didn't. \nBollocks, anyway. \nRight, I'm gonna have to handle this myself. \nBasically, the thing is the house. \nIt wasn't Dougal's to give away. \nIt would be great to give it back. \nI think you'd be interested in the work we do here. \nI hope it's not some hideaway for paedophile priests, that whole thing disgusted me. \nNiamh, we're not all like that. \nSay there's 200 million priests and 5% of them are paedophiles. \nThat's still only ten million. \nNo, we want a world free of intolerance and hypocrisy. \nReally, Father? Yes. \nIf there's one thing I hate it's hypocrisy. \nI mean the sexism rampant in the Church is appalling! - Yes. \n- God! It gets my goat! We're different on Craggy Island. \nWe don't like any of that. \nAh, Ted! Who is this lovely girl? Now, Ted, you were only supposed to pick one. \nDon't call me a lovely girl. \nI've sold 20 million records. \nWhat? Anyway, Ted, what do you think? This one or this one? You know, I like this one. \nWell, that's a nice one, Liam. \nBut I like the colour of this one. \nOh! I just don't know. \nWell, they're both great. \nWhichever one you pick, it'll be lovely. \nThanks, Ted. \nYou see? All sorts of alternative lifestyles catered for. \nWe're a refuge for priests like Father Liam. \nWhere else could he give a sermon while dressed like Joan Crawford? Please, Niamh, don't take away our house. \nDon't stop our good work. \nYou know, I have to say, Father. \nI had no idea that priests could be involved in such good work. \nYou have the old-fashioned view of drunken, lecherous priests. \n- That stereotype is long gone! - (Alarm ) (Alarm stops ) (Crashing upstairs ) (Thudding) (Clomping down stairs ) (Glass shattering) Drink! - Woman! - Father Billy! Can't talk just at the moment, see you later. \nFather Billy would be one of our more old-style priests. \nHe pops around for a good old debate once in a while. \nButhe came from upstairs. \nYes, he hides around the house so he can spring a topic on me. \nMaybe he'd hide in the bathroom and I'd go to the toilet and he'd jump out and say, \"Women priests!\" And I'd think very fast and say, \"I'm in favour. \n\" Anyway, the main thing I wanted to say is we're huge, huge fans of yours here. \nWe must have every album you ever made. \nWould you like me to sign them for you? Oh, that'd be great. \nCould you? Of course you should stay here. \nAfter I've signed the albums, I'll give the keys back. \nI'll just go and get the records. \nThank you. \nThank you. \n(Gasping for breath) Here, hererecords. \nWhat shall I put on them? Don't care. \nFather, I finished digging that drainage ditch. \nNo, Mrs Doyle. \nYou wanted me to clean those roof slates. \nMrs Doyle, no, don't! I thought I might do them tomorrow when there's less chance of me falling off and being killed. \nAnd then Sting fell down the stairs. \nWill Father Ted be coming later? No. \nHe has to stay home so Mrs Doyle can come out. \nIt's why I gave him the house back, one night out a week for Mrs Doyle. \nMaybe I should just go and check on them. \nSit down. \nNow, come on. \nLet's enjoy ourselves, sisters. \nNo men around, we can do what we like. \nIs that meat?! Do I still have to pay for this? (Ted) There's no button on the kettle! Where are the tea bags? Fire! Put me out, Ted, will you? I just wanted a cup of tea! I just wanted my tea!"

      "(Mozart: Requiem ) # Rex! # Rex! # Rex! # (Mrs Doyle humming off-key ) Ah, Father. \nI see you put up the old cross. \nWhat's that all about? People may be confused about where the parochial house is. \nSo I put a big cross up in the garden. \nI hope they know it means I'm a priest and not some madman. \nSome madman's put up a cross. \nLovely. \n- Ted, I'm off rollerblading. \n- All right, Dougal. \n(Phone ) Hello, Craggy Island parochial house. \nFather Ted Crilly. \n- Hello, Ted. \nDick Byrne here. \n- Oh. \nDick. \nI thought I'd wish you all the best for Lent this year. \nWhat? Oh, yeah, Lent. \nWhat are you giving up? Being the biggest eejit in the priesthood? Seriously, Ted. \nIf we could just put joking aside for a minute. \n'Lent is a solemn time of year. \n' We've had our disagreements, but at the end of the day we are brothers in Christ. \nOh, well. \nWe're making a special effort this year. \nI've given up cigarettes, Father Johnson alcohol and Father MacDuff skateboarding. \nAnd the atmosphere of serenity and devotion to Our Lord in the parochial house is very special indeed. \nRight. \nSo what about it, Ted? Will you make a similar effort? Will you join us, Ted? Will you go the extra mile this year? I suppose you're right, Dick. \nWe should make a special effort. \nIt'll be worth it, Ted. \nGod bless you. \nGoodbye, Dick, and erm G-God bless you, Dick. \nSo, that's it. \nI'm giving up the fags. \nFather Jack can give the old drink a miss and no more rollerblading until Easter. \nEaster's miles away. \nA sacrifice isn't easy. \nDon't forget why we do this. \nI know. \nBecause of the sacrifice Our Lord More importantly, I'm not gonna be beaten by Father Byrne in the giving-things-up competition. \nAnd that's what this is, a competition. \nWe've got to show him what we can do. \nEspecially after that Scrabble fiasco. \nYou've never told us what happened. \nI don't know how he did it, he must've cheated! But he got all his words to say \"Useless priest can't say Mass. \n\" So no more fags, rollerblading or booze until Easter. \nAll right. \nWho wants their afternoon drink? Drink? Oh, yes! - No. \n- No?! You said you'd give it up for a couple of days. \n- What?! - Offer it up for Our Lord. \nArlord? Who's Arlord? No, Our Lord. \nI suppose I made your vow for you. \nBut I know you'd like to make a sacrifice. \nSacrifice? Arse! It's a special time of the year for all of us. \nDrink! Drink! You won't find any there. \n- I've put them somewhere safe. \n- Where? Don't sulk, Father. \nHere we go. \nNo more fags for me now until Easter. \nAh, great. \nNo problem there at all. \n(Chuckling and sighing) God Almighty. \nI don't even miss them at all. \nThis is easy! Yes, I'm not even thinking about smoking. \nNot thinking about it! It's beginning to kick in, Ted. \nMe, too. \nGod, this is terrible. \nI don't like this at all! Maybe we should stick with it, Ted. \nWe've come through worse. \nDon't forget Dick Byrne. \nBlah, blah, blah, blah Blah, blah, blah, blah - Don't you think so, Ted? - Hm? Oh. \nI certainly do. \nAbsolutely. \nHow are you doing, Father? You all right? Do you want me to Blah, blah, blah, blah Blah, blah, blah - Father? - Is he all right? I think he's just circling the airport. \n- (Doorbell) - Better get that. \nYou Ok? What? Oh, yeah. \nDon't make a show of yourself. \n\"Yes, Father. \nHello, Father. \nYou're so great, Fathe.\n\" - Oh, you make me sick. \n- You're feckin' worse. \n\"Oh, Father, you're brillian.\nFather, you should be Pope. \n\" It doesn't impress him. \nMakes me sick. \nGod, you're an - Ah, Father. \n- Hello, John, Mary. \nFather, you look wonderful. \nIs that a new outfit? - We brought you some Easter eggs. \n- Oh, that's terribly nice. \nI think it comes to about 8. \nWe thought we'd bring it down to you. \nWe're going on holidays and we're not sure when we'll be back. \n- Yes, we're going to Rome. \n- Oh! So looking forward to it! We might see your friend. \nWho's that, Sophia Loren? No, Father. \nThe Pope! He's no friend of mine! Actually, that might've sounded a little disrespectful. \nSorry. \nNo problem, Father. \nAhhhhhhh. \n(Snoring) (Empty bottles clanging) (Thud) (Ted groaning) (Sighs ) One day. \nYou'd think we could go one day without giving in. \nHello? Hello. \nWhen I think of the sacrifices Matty Hislop made. \n- Who? - Matty Hislop. \nA drunkard who found God and punished himself for his sins. \nHe did all kinds of things. \nHe had this terrible allergy to cats. \nSo he used to carry a kitten in his pocket. \nAnd sniff it from time to time. \nHis head just inflated like a balloon. \nFair play to him. \nCould you not knock the rollerblading on the head for two weeks? I know. \nI know, Ted. \nI used to be happy enough with the old bike, get a great buzz going down to the shops. \nBut after a while, it just wasn't enough. \nI just kept going for bigger and bigger thrills. \nBut I can handle it. \nI could quit any time I want. \nWell, you tried to quit yesterday and you couldn't. \nYou're right, Ted. \nI admit it. \nI have a problem. \nCome on. \nNo need for that, not now we're getting outside help. \nCome on, come on. \nGod, why do nuns have such awful music when you're on hold? If I hear Ave Maria one more time, I don't know. \nExcuse me! # Ave Maria # - 'Excuse me!' - Yes? 'How much longer am I going to be on hold?' She'll be with you in a second, Father. \n# Ave Maria # Hello, Sister Mary Gondola, how can I help you? Ah, hello. \nMy name is Father Ted Crilly. \nCould you send somebody out? We have a small problem here keeping our Lenten vows. \nWhat do you wish to give up? Well, erm, cigarettes, alcohol and, ermrollerblading. \nAll right. \nOn special offer this month we have the Lenten package. \n150 plus VAT plus booking fee That's 200. \n200?! I'm not trying to buy cocaine! We have a basic offer at 50. \nThat'll do fine, thanks. \nNow, how do you wish to pay? We accept all major credit cards. \n- (Beeping) - Hold, please, Father. \n# Ave Maria # (Snoring and growling) Listen, I'll have to ring you back. \nWhat's up with him, Ted? The last of the alcohol has left his system. \nHe might actually be sober. \nIs that it? Are you seeing things as they really are at last? Oh, my God! Yes, that's it, all right. \nSobriety for Father Jack must be like taking some mad hallucinogenic. \nWhere are the other two? The other two? Ah, I see. \nThe old vision's back to normal. \n- There's just the two of us. \n- What do you two do, then? We're priests. \nWhat? Priests! Don't tell me I'm still on that feckin' island! Well Well, yes, Father. \nHow do you feel? Must be great to be sober every once in a while. \nOr evenevery 12 years. \n- Chair! - Well done, Father. \n- Curtains. \n- Yes, that's right! Floor! All coming back to you, is it, Father? Gobshite! Yes! I remember! I remember! I'm off on my Lenten pilgrimage now, Fathers. \n- Off to St Patrick's Hill. \n- What's that, Ted? A big mountain. \nYou have to take your socks off to go up it. \nAt the top, they chase you back down with a big plank. \nIt's great fun. \nOh, I don't want it to be any fun at all, Father. \nI want a good miserable time. \nk eep me on the straight and narrow. \nI met a couple there last year, it did them the world of good. \nThey were a bit obsessed with the old s-e-x. \nGod, I'm glad I never think of that type of thing, that whole sexual world. \nGod, when you think of it, it's a dirty, filthy thing, isn't it? Can you imagine, Father? Looking up at your husband and him standing over you with his lead in his hand, wanting you to degrade yourself. \nGod Almighty, can you imagine that, Father? Can you picture it, Father? Get a good mental picture. \nCan you see him there, ready to do the business? (Doorbell) DOORBELL! Doorbell, Mrs Doyle, the doorbell. \nHey, hey, hey! You there! What the hell is this? That's a spoon, Father. \nCome on, she'll be here. \n- Hello Ah! Sister Assumpta! - Hello, Father. \nDougal, do you remember Sister Assumpta? Ah, no. \nShe was here last year. \nThen we stayed with her in the convent in kildare. \nDo you remember it? Ah, you do. \nYou were hit by the car when you went down the shops. \nYou must remember. \nThen you won 100 with your lottery card? You must remember it. \nWeren't you arrested for shoplifting? I remember we had to go down to the police station to get you. \nAnd the police station went on fire? And you had to be rescued by helicopter? Do you remember? You can't remember any of that? The helicopter! When you fell out of the helicopter! Over the zoo! Do you remember the tigers? You don't remember? You were wearing your blue jumper. \nAhh! Sister Assumpta! Hello! Hello. \nI had no idea you were with the Matty Hislop crowd. \nEver since I read his pamphlets, abstinence has been both my keeper and my reward. \nGreat. \nAnyhow, all we want is the basic 50 job, the bare essentials. \nk eep us off the booze and fags and the rollerblading. \nI'm afraid the rollerblading is my own particular vice. \nWell, we'll do our best. \nI'm looking forward to it. \nYou know, I sort of am. \nDo us good to exercise the willpower. \nFather Jack, are you looking forward to it? You remember Father Jack? - Yes. \n- Nan! No, it's \"nun\". \nNun! Ahhhhh! Bye, Father! He's just gone for his walk. \n(Foghorn ) Good morning, Fathers. \nBreakfast in five minutes. \nGod Almighty. \nWhat was that thing? Is there a fire in the house? I suppose it's just time to get up. \nIt'sit's 5am. \nLook, Dougal. \n5am. \nGod, I've never seen a clock at 5am before. \n(Giggling) She's obviously made a mistake. \nLet's go back to bed. \nFair enough, Ted. \nWhat are you doing? Writing her a note to say we don't usually get up till later. \nOh. \nGood figuring, Ted. \n(Foghorn ) Oh, I don't know. \nA bit of breakfast and I suppose we'll be fine. \n- God, I hope so, Ted. \n- Sister Assumpta, we're only down for the basic booze, fags and rollerblading deal. \nThe getting up early thing, it's great but - This is water. \n- That's right, Father. \nAll right. \nHaving a bit of a laugh with the thickos from the island. \nWhere's our real breakfast? Ted, I'd love a Pop-Tart. \nYes, Father Dougal likes his Pop-Tarts first thing. \nI don't think Pop-Tarts have any place in Our Lord's plan for the world. \nThey have as much a place as anything else. \nMaybe He doesn't take a personal interest but I'm sure he delegates it to someone important. \n- What about Frosties? - The same thing. \nNot His idea, but He gave them the green light. \nOh, righ.\nBut if you take Sugar Puffs or Lucky Charms FATHERS, COULD YOU PLEA! Could you please stop having that conversation? Just finish your breakfast and come outside for a daily punishment. \nFair enough, so. \nWe'll just finish the Daily what? I'm sorry, what did you say there? Your daily punishment. \nMatty Hislop's ten-step programme to rid you of pride, the greatest obstacle to inner fulfilment. \nOh. \nThat soundssounds great. \nNow, how are we two doing? - (Ted shivering) F-Fine. \n- More ice? No, I might enjoy that too much. \nVery refreshing, the old ice. \nSoon we can begin the ten steps. \nWhat? This isn't the first one? There's still ten to go? Father, of course! This is just to cleanse you. \n- A form of preparation. \n- For what?! Are we going into space?! I can't feel my legs! Oh, God. \nStill ten to go. \nHopefully it'll just involve a bit of an old pray. \nAhhh! Oh, God, I'm looking forward to this. \nWhoop! (Screaming) Ted, guess what she's replaced my mattress with? Oh, that's it. \nThat's it. \nShe's obviously insane, Dougal. \nWe've got to get out of here. \n- Where'll we go? - We know loads of people. \nWhat about Mwengwe? His parents are away for the weekend and he's got satellite. \n(Sighing) Dougal, he lives in Addis Ababa. \n- What about Dick Byrne? - I'm not ringing Dick Byrne. \nI know. \nI'll call Father Larry Duff. \nHe'll put us up for a while. \n(Mobile phone and buzzer) (Audience groans ) (Mobile continues ringing) Oh, wait, he told me not to call tonight. \nHe's got this important thing on. \nI suppose it'll have to be Father Dick Byrne on Rugged Island. \nCome on. \nI'll leave her a note saying we've gone to a funeral. \nOr an autopsy. \nWhy don't we say we had to go to an autopsy instead? That'll be more exciting. \nNo, Dougal. \nA funeral is more believable. \n- Oh, right. \n- Now, listen. \nWe've got to do this as quietly as possible, Ok? Don't suddenly panic. \nIf we take it easy, we won't wake her. \nWhat was that? (Ted) RUN! (Crashing and pounding down stairs ) (Door opening, shutting) (Car revving) (Sister Assumpta ) Quiet in there! Come on, Fathers, we're to get an early start or we'll miss the rain. \nRight. \n(Ted) God, what a dump. \nThey're probably asleep. \nI'll just knock gently. \nOh, right, so's you won't wake them up. \nNo, I'll wake them so they can let us in. \nBut then shouldn't you just knock loudly? Right. \nGood point, Dougal. \n- Ted, maybe they're not home. \n- No, I definitely heard something. \nI should've known. \nYou just can't trust Dick Byrne. \nAs priests go, he's a really bad priest. \nYeah. \nAnd we've still got I know. \n- (Ted chuckling) - Erm This isn't what it looks like. \nWell, this certainly puts a different spin on things. \nYou won't tell anyone, will you? I couldn't help it, they were just sochocolatey. \nI can't go back until after Easter. \nPlease don't tell them I gave into temptation. \nShe's been eating chocolate! Oh, God! Please, Father. \nYou must be so disappointed in me. \nIf there's anything I can do to make it up. \nWell, ah Here's a mad idea. \n( # Rock) Hello, Sister. \nHow can I help you? I'm back, Fathers! Oh, my God!"

'Divorce Referendum is way in front. \n'Divorce Referendum is speeding towards victory. \n' - Yes, yes! - 'Oh, no!' 'Disaster for Divorce Referendum 'as he turns in the opposite direction 'and simply runs off the course. \n' Oh, flip! You flipping, flipping flipper! Oh, it's the knacker's yard for you, pal! (Door bangs ) (Man on radio ) 'So what role do you see the Church assuming?' Hello, Ted. \nWhat are you listening to? Oh, it's just a programme about the Church and God and so on. \nOh, right. \nRight. \nWhere's Father Jack, Dougal? - Where's Father Jack? - Yes. \nFather Jack, where is he? He's in his Oh. \n- Erm - You've lost him again, right? I have, Ted, yeah. \nYou took him out for a walk and you lost himagain. \nThat must've been what happened all right. \nSo what have you got to say for yourself? Well, like I said the last time, it won't happen again. \nDougal, are you not going to go and look for him? Ted, he'll come back. \nWhat's the worst that can happen? He could have an accident and be killed. \nOh. \nEr, wait a second, Ted. \nIs that not Jack there? (Snoring) Ah, Dougal. \nYou didn't even get him out the door, did you? I thought the wheelchair felt a bit lighter today all right. \nCome on, help me get him up. \n(Groaning) (Jack muttering) - Dougal, take off his gloves. \n- Right so, Ted. \n- Ted. \n- Hmm? Ted, they're not gloves. \nGod, they're very hairy hands altogether, aren't they? - What's wrong? - I don't know. \nDo you remember the time his head went septic? Yes. \nI mean, I didn't think a whole head could go septic. \nI mean, a whole head, you know? But that's Jack for you. \nI'd better look in the book. \nRight. \nHold his hand up there, Dougal. \nWell, he got up to stage four after drinking that brake fluid. \nI think this could be a stage six. \n- Hello to the lot of yous. \n- Hello, Mrs Doyle. \nAh, would you look at him there with his hairy hands? Yes, and we're going to have to call Dr Sinnot. \nHe's good. \nI had to go myself a couple of weeks ago. \nReally? I didn't know you were ill. \nWhat was the trouble? A bit of a woman's problem. \nI was having a bit of trouble I'd better ring him before it's too late! (Phone buzzes ) - So it's the hairy hands. \n- Yes. \n- A stage six? - It looks like it, yeah. \nI'll get ready upstairs. \nTed, why is Jack so scared of doctors? They remind him of illness and his own mortality. \nHe hated visiting the sick. \nOh, God, he hates the sick. \nAnd the poor as well. \n- The poor really got on his nerves. \n- And the needy. \n(Sighing) Them as well. \nWhat was it he used to say? He had a term for them. \n- A shower of bastards. \n- That was it. \nWhen we bring the doctor in, just behave normal. \nJust pretend he's a normal visitor. \nWe don't want Jack to suspect anything. \nDoctor? Ready? All right, in you go. \nRemember completely normal. \nSo it's off to St Clabbert's again, Doctor? Yes. \nIt's more for your sake than for his. \nThat hair thing can be very contagious. \n- How long will they have him? - Hard to sa.\nCould be for a while. \nActually, you should be prepared. \nIt might be better for his own sake if he doesn't come back. \nGreat! I mean, oh, no. \nWe'll just have to grin and bear it, I suppose. \nI'll try and break it to him gently. \nThanks, Doctor. \nYes! Wahey! Father Jack? Do you remember that great time you had at St Clabbert's? Remember the fun you had with those nuns fussing about you? Dr Sinnot thinks another spell there would do a world of good. \nOk, it might mean giving up the odd glass of sherry or two, but that's all for your own good. \nYou'll have a fantastic time, it'll be one big laugh with all those nuns fussing all the Father? Father? Where's he gone? (Motor chugging) God, Ted, how did the sergeant catch Father Jack at all? Well, Dougal He's an elderly priest driving a Flymo around a small island. \nHow hard could it be? Anyway, he's up there in St Clabbert's now. \nIt's weird the way you get used to something. \nSeems like only yesterday he was here drinking his head off. \nDougal, it was yesterday. \nYeah, but that's why I said it SEEMED like yesterday. \nRight, because it WAS yesterday. \nYeah. \nWhat time are Father Rory and Father k en coming on Wednesday? About six. \nSix o'clock? - Yes. \n- Right. \nGood, good. \nActually, it's just as well Jack's not here. \nHe can get very irritable around strangers. \nJack was very bad around strangers. \nAnd people he knew. \nYes, very bad around strangers and people he knew. \n- Anyway, night, Dougal. \n- Night, Ted. \n(Ted) Aw, damn! (Whistling) No, Dougal, it's not morning. \nI forgot to wind the clock. \nOh, right. \nSorry about that, Ted. \nHello there, Father Father Who are you? Who are you? Father Ted Crilly. \nVery pleased to meet you. \nOh. \nWhat's this? Oh, I see. \nIt's from the Bishop. \nYou're taking Father Jack's place. \nThis is a surprise. \nHas Mrs Doyle shown you around? Well, anyway, welcome to Craggy Island. \nThe meals are at 11, one, half-two, three, five, seven and nine. \nAnd if you ever want a snack, you can ask Mrs Doyle. \nNo, er No, actually, that's actually mine. \nWell, you go ahead there and have it anyway. \nDougal, this is Father Fintan Stack. \nHe'll be staying with us now. \nOh, right, yeah. \nThis is the brains of the operation. \nAh, no, that'd be Ted. \nI wanna listen to some music. \nOh, go ahead, there. \nI wasn't asking for permission. \n( # Jungle music) ( # Muffled thumping music) So, erm What do you think of Father Stack? Well, erm It says in his note that they never found a suitable parish for him. \n- He's not a very nice man, is he? - I've never met anyone like him. \nWho would he be like? Hitler or one of those mad fellows? Oh, worse than Hitler. \nYou wouldn't find Hitler playing jungle music at three in the morning. \nGod, he almost makes Jack seem normal. \nYou know, he nearly does. \n(Howling) Right, carry on. \nI was going to say you'd almost miss Father Jack. \nHe had his funny little ways. \nBut whenever he'd hit you, he'd never do it out of spite. \nHe'd only do it because he thought it was funny or whatever. \nI suppose when you think about it now, it was funny. \nRemember that time he gave you a big kick up the b-o-t-t-y? And do you remember when you were bending over him, and he held your nose so tight that you had to open your mouth and then he dropped a big spider in it? No, that wasn't funny, Dougal. \nIt was funny when he kicked you up the arse. \nIt wasn't funny when he put the spider in my mouth. \n- It was, Ted. \n- No, it wasn't, Dougal! - Ah, Ted. \n- Dougal! Anyway, he's gone now. \nIt's funny how you miss someone's little ways. \n(Sighing) (Sighing) (Screaming) ( # Muffled jungle continues ) God, I've had enough. \nIt sounds like someone drilling holes in a wall or something. \n- I'll have a word. \n- Careful. \nCome on, I think he's out. \n- What's up, Ted? - Ted's gone mad. \n- Lead on, MacTed! - Shh. \n- Right, the coast is clear. \n- Father Jack's not here? No, he has the hair thing again. \nHe's in Jurassic Park. \nOh, right. \nSt Clabbert's. \nFather Walton's up there, I hear. \n- Sherry all right? - Lovely. \nDid you know Father Coogan at all, Ted? Hmm Oh, yes. \nFather Tom Coogan. \nWasn't he in Africa? He was, with Father Shortall and that load. \nThen he was back in Wicklow. \nI think Windy Shepherd Henderson was his priest there. \nWindy Shepherd Henderson that was in Tralee? No, a different Windy Shepherd Henderson. \n- There's four of them. \n- At least. \nOne of them was with Father Daley in Chicago. \nWasn't he the first man on the scene when Malcom X was assassinated? No, that was Father Burke. \nFather Daley had the lump on his head in the shape of Connaught. \nLike Father Caroline - he lost the use of his ears in an accident. \n- He's deaf? - No, just lost the use of his ears. \nHe used to be able to wiggle them. \nRemember Father O'Reilly? He's in Clare. \nThey moved him after he owned up to that OJ Simpson thing. \nFather Bigley from Ardee did his wedding, I think. \n- Father Bigley? Is he not dead? - No, he just looked dead. \nTed, did you say Father Larry Duff was coming? God, I'd better give him a call. \nI hope he can make it. \nLarry is tremendous fun. \n(Mobile phone ) Ahh! No, he must have it turned off. \nGod, I wonder where Dougal is? Come on, Ted. \nShall we watch the sports video? Oh, yes. \nCome on, Ted. \nAh, here's the lads. \nAnd away they go! Ah, look at your man at the back! I remember this. \n(All cheering) (All) Look at Mrs Doyle! - She looks great on the telly! - She's wearing the hat for a bet! (Ted) I'd say so. \nOh, here's Buckin' Bronco! Or Hopalong Cassidy. \n- Here's the champ. \n- Fair play. \nFair play to him. \n(Cheering) What are we watching? We're looking at the sports day. \nLots of young fellows running around in shorts. \nThat's the kind of thing you like looking at. \nAnd I bet you like that, too. \nYou're probably imagining what they'd look like without shorts. \nYou're sitting there, imagining that, with a big smile on your face. \nYou dirty fecker. \nIf you're trying to embarrass us, you're not succeeding. \nYes, I am. \nWell, I have to say, I think that you're a very rude man. \nIf you ever say that to me again, I'll put your head through the wall. \n(Crashing) - Dougal, where did you go to? - Ted! How are you? - Dougal, what the? - Yes? What, Ted? - What? - What? - Have you been drinking? - I have, Ted. \nI been drinking like a mad eejit. \nNo, no, wait. \nNo, I haven't. \nDougal, I'm ashamed of you. \nTed, Ted, Ted. \nCome here, Teddy, Teddy, Ted. \nYou're my best friend. \nGod, I love being a priest. \nWe're all going to heaven, lads, wahey! Perhaps I should explain. \nYour friend and I were enjoying a bottle of whisky I found upstairs. \nWell, that is the last straw. \nI'm driving. \nI'm driving home, I'm perfectly capable. \nBy the way, I got the keys of your car and I drove it into a big wall. \nIf you don't like it, tough. \nI had my fun and that's all that matters. \n- Ted, I can see up your trousers. \n- Right. \nThat's it. \nI thought giving alcohol to Dougal was the last straw, but it was the second last straw, because this is definitely the last bit of straw inthe thing. \nThere is no more straw left! - Ted, it's a little late. \n- Yes, I think we should go. \n- No, you don't have to go. \n- I think we should. \nWoooo! Bye, girls! Pair of wankers. \nOh! Come on, Dougal, we've had enough of Father Stack for one evening. \nTo the pub, Ted! ( # Jungle music) - Hey, Ted, what's going on? - We're going to kidnap Jack. \nkidnapping, wow! What will we get for him? - Shut up, Dougal. \nYou ready? - I'm with you, Ted. \nRight so, let's go, then. \n(Doorbell) Hello? - This is a bit mad, Ted. \n- Shh! Why don't we ask the nuns to give him back? Dr Sinnot said moving him might be dangerous. \nAnyway, I got a second opinion. \n- Who from? - Mrs Doyle. \nTed, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. \nI mean, kidnapping! It's not kidnapping, it's bringing him back to where he belongs. \nIt's like Lassie Come Home, with Father Jack as Lassie. \n- Who are we, then? - I don't konw. \nThe other people. \nYou're Roddy McDowell and I'm Liz Taylor. \nFine. \nI just wanted to get that straight in me head. \n- Right, let's go. \n- Right. \n- Come on, Dougal. \n- (Shouting) Right behind you! Shut up! k eep it quiet. \nLook around and see if there's a light switch. \n(All shouting) (Silence ) - (Nun ) What's all that noise?! - Quick, Dougal, here. \n(Nun ) Calm down, all of you! Some people are trying to get some sleep! Arse! Feck! Oh! Dougal, that's not Father Jack. \n- Hello, Father Walton. \n- Feck off! - Will he not do, Ted? - No. \nI don't think so, no. \nA stage 12. \nI never thought I'd see one. \nAh, Ted, can we not keep him? No. \nCome on, let's get Father Jack. \n- You got the torch, Dougal? - Yes. \n- Arse! - Feck! - Drink! - Girls! - Drink! - Feck! - Drink! - Feck! - Arse! - Girls! (Posh voice ) I really shouldn't be here. \n- Drink! - Drink! - Drink! - Drink! Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls! (Jack) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! - All right, Father, all right. \n- Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! - Drink! Drink! - Try upstairs, Father. \n(Jack whimpering) - Jumping on my picture again? - You got a problem with that? - None. \nEnjoy yourself. \n- What was all that noise? That's Father Jack, the fellow you replaced. \nTell him to get lost. \nI'm here now. \nYou might like the pleasure of telling him yourself. \nAnd what happened to his whisky. \n(Shattering glass, screaming) He'll fill you in. \nI'm supposed to be scared? Drink! - Listen to that, Dougal. \n- I don't hear anything. \nThat's what I mean. \nThe sound of silence. \nNo, I still don't hear anything. \nI'm sorry I didn't disinfect Jack's chair like you told me. \nIt's my fault that lad got the hair thing. \nDon't worry. \nI'm sure he's fine up in Jurassic Park. \nBest place for him. \nk eep him out of trouble. \nAnyway, how are we getting on in there, Father? It's a great invention, isn't it? And no more St Clabbert's. \n(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink! Anyway, time for bed. \nCome on, Dougal. \n(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! (Man on loudhailer) 'Fathers, please. \nCalm down. \n'Someone step in there, please. \nThat really is not on. \n'You're ruining it. \n'Sister, if you could just step in there. \n' Break it up, break it up, Fathers. \nBreak it up. \nPut that down. \n(Men ) Drink!

      "Here we go, Dougal, 22, 23 This is us. \nWe should've got a window seat. \nNo, Father, you sit over there. \n(Bottles clanking) I'd be too nervous to sit by the window. \n- Why is that? - I've never liked flying. \nIf God wanted us to fly, He'd put airports nearer the city. \nExcuse me, Father, you're sitting on my cardigan. \n(Wheezing) Could you Could you not breathe like that? You're making a noise. \nNow, really, Father, this is a no-smoking flight. \n- So, did you enjoy yourself? - Oh, I did. \nkilnettle's great. \nIt must be the holiest shrine in the world. \nTop ten, anyway. \nFunny, Our Lady appearing on a golf course like that. \n- Where exactly did it happen? - On the 13th hole. \nShe appeared to a fellow on the green. \nHe was putting for a birdie and the ball hit her foot. \nGod Almighty. \nThen what? He just took a dropped ball and put it down to experience. \nHello, Ted. \nOn the old plane, I see. \nI am, yes. \nSame as yourself. \nWho was that, Ted? That's Father Joe Briefly, a pal of mine from St Colum's. \nWe used to have a nickname for him there Oh, yes, very funny. \nWe used to call him Himalaya Joe. \nHe had all this hair growing between his toes. \nLike the Abominable Snowman. \nVery funny. \nAnd did you have a nickname, Ted? No, I didn't. \n- You must have had one. \n- No! - Father Briefly! - Dougal! Father, do you remember Ted's nickname at St Colum's? Let's see, what's that it was? Don't worry, Joe, I'll tell him myself. \nShut up, Dougal. \nIt was Father Fluffybottom. \nSome of the priests caught a glance of my rear end in the showers after a game of football. \nWell, I had all this downy fluff growing around that whole area. \nOh, yes. \nFather Fluffybottom. \nHilarious stuff. \nWhat did you do in the end? Shave it off? Shave it off? No, not at all. \nOh, right. \n- Father Briefly! - Dougal! It was Father Fluffybottom! Oh, yes, that's right. \nBecause he had this big load of fluffy hair on his behind. \nWhat did you do in the end, Ted? Shave it off? No, I didn't. \nYou can't get razors with handles long enough to reach downto your behind. \nRemember what they called you? Himalaya Joe. \nBecause of all the thick black hair growing between your toes. \nThat was actually a medical condition. \nHeh heh. \n'This is your pilot speaking. \nFasten your seat belts for take-off. \n' Oh! What the? Who did that? Someone messing there. \nWhat did you get, Dougal? I got this at the gift shop back at the airport. \nBut Dougal, we have a tape dispenser. \n- Why'd you buy that one? - This is no ordinary one. \nWatch. \n(Recording) 'You have used one inch of sticky tape. \nGod bless you. \n' Dougal, that is absolutely brilliant. \nAlready I can think of hundreds of uses for it. \n- Get anything else? - I did, yeah. \nLook. \n- What's it do? - Squeeze it, it's a joke telephone. \n(Squeaks ) Dougal, this is a dog toy. \nWhat? No, it's not. \nIt's a joke telephone. \nDougal, this is a toy for dogs. \nThis is something people give their dogs on their birthday. \nSeriously, Ted. \nIt's a joke telephone. \nYou tell someone it's a phone and they'll try and make a call. \nDougal, who would think this is a telephone? Even a dog knows this isn't a phone. \nTed, we'll agree to differ, all right? We won't! Because you're very, very wrong. \nLook, did the picture not give you a clue? Why is the dog so happy? Somebody has given him a rubber telephone that makes a noise! No, no! He's laughing because someone's trying to make a call on the telephone. \nDogs don't have the same sense of humour as us! They're not as advanced. \nBuy something sensible, like this. \nNow Put a coin in that. \nWow. \nGod, Ted. \nThat is fantastic. \nWhat is it, a sort of money box? Yes. \nWith something like this, it would be so easy to make it look cheap and tacky. \nBut just look at her there. \nPure class. \nNow, come on, now. \nThe joke's over. \n- Here we go. \n- Oh, God. \n- What's up with you, Ted? - It's just the tension. \nIt'll be Ok in a minute. \nWouldn't it be terrible to be killed in a plane crash? - Yes. \n- Or if you just fell out. \nIf the floor just disappeared and you fell out. \nYou'd fall for ages and ages Feeling a bit better, Ted? No, Dougal, not really, no. \nTell you what. \nMaybe I'll give Larry Duff a call. \nHe developed a fear of flying after all his crashes. \nHe went to a hypnotherapist. \nTold me to give him a call any time I was nervous. \nOh, for God's sak.\n- What was that? - Just a bit of turbulence. \nGod, I wish I wasn't so nervous. \nLarry says you've more chance of being trampled by donkeys than of being killed in a plane crash. \n(Mobile phone ) (Stampeding hooves ) No, he's not picking up. \n(Gibbers like a monkey ) Ted! Hello. \nFather Fay, hello. \n(Gibbering) Ah, yes, it's very good. \n(Gibbering) I am a very big fan of his, all right. \nOr should I say, \"Awright?\" (Gibbering) No, there's no mention of it so far. \n- (Grunting) - God, Ted, he has me driven mad! He asked me to take him up to see the cockpit. \nCockpit? Ah, Ted, can I have a look, too? Well, Dougal, I'm not sure. \nWhat is he up to now? He's going mad with excitement, I'd better go. \nComing, Father? Dougal. \nDon't touch anything. \nWe don't want an action replay of the Sealink incident. \nFair enough, Ted. \n- Hello! - There you are, Father. \n- You wanted the official tour. \n- God, yes. \nHe's talked about nothing else! Will you calm down, you little monkey man? Basically, these are the main controls. \nOver here we have the gauges for the engines. \n- Father. \nFather! - What? I wasn't gonna press it. \nSorry, I was only asking if you'd ever been in a cockpit. \nNo. \nBut I was on the bridge of a Sealink ferry once and I was looking at the controls - (Coughing) - . \n. \nand nothing happened at all. \nRight. \nThat's it! (Man laughing) Hey, come on, now. \nWhat's so funny? Just come on, now. \nThe joke's over. \n- Who are you? - What do you mean? You blind? I'm the man you've been pestering with paper. \n- I have not. \n- Why are you laughing? What's the big laugh about? I'm listening to comedy on these. \nIt's Mr Bean. \nOh, right. \nAnd yes, I am blind, as a matter of fact. \nIs it since birth or is it a more recent thing, you know? Since birth. \nRight, but I suppose your other senses make up for it. \nI hear that blind people's other senses are more alert. \nSo to speak. \nI suppose you can smell things from ten miles away and hear things before they happen. \n- No. \n- No sixth sense of any kind? I suppose in your case it'd be a fifth sense, seeing as you've only got the four. \nUnless there's another one missing I don't know about. \nHow's your sense of touch? Could you go away now, please? Yes, I'll do just that. \nWill you not calm down? Come on, now. \nWe'll head back. \nSay thank you to Mr Pilot. \n- Ahhh! - Oh, God. \nHe must've seen his reflection. \nHe's not supposed to. \n- He doesn't know he's a priest. \n- (Shouting) Stop it, Father. \nSettle down. \nGet him off me! I can't see! (Pilot) Father McGuire, press the emergency button! - What? - The emergency button! - What does it look like? - It's \"emergency\" written on it! Right! I'll just go to the old toilet. \n( # Muzak) Is, erm Is this the toilet? First-class toilet, sir. \nDo you have a first-class ticket? No. \nThen you have to go across the way. \n(Father Fay gibbering) - Ted? - What? - Can I have a quick word? - Yes. \nYes, hold on. \nRight. \nWhat's wrong, Dougal? Well, slight problem, Ted. \nWhat? Well, apparently someone pressed a button in the cockpit. \nI think the person might have emptied one of the fuel tanks. \nThere's not enough fuel to make it to the airport. \nRight. \nSo that would mean what? An emergency landing? - Yeah, an emergency landing. \n- Right. \nBut we don't actually have enough fuel to make it to a place to make an emergency landing. \nAnd there's only two parachutes. \nNo, wait a second. \nBefore you carry on, what's this film called again? No, no, no. \nIt's not a film. \n- It's not a film? - No. \n- So this is actually happening. \n- Yes. \n- This is happening now, to us. \n- It is, yeah. \nDougal, here's a mad guess just out of the blue, but did you press the button? Ah, now, Ted, come on! - Did you, Dougal? - I did, yeah. \n- Hello, Ted. \nHeard the news? - Yes, Noel. \n- What'll we do? - Did you press the emergency button? - No. \n- Shouldn't we? Careful. \nThere might be a fine for improper use. \nThis is definitely an emergency. \nLet's keep the other priests calm, not a word about this when we get back inside. \n(Alarm horn ) (Recording) 'Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!' Nothing happened. \nWhat does it do? Never needed it before. \nFather, who gets the parachutes? God, that's a tough decision. \nYou're right. \nMaybe we should just not tell anybody. \nThrow them off the plane, pretend they never existed. \nNo, I don't think we should do that. \nI have a better idea. \nRight. \nThis is my idea. \nWhat we should do is this So, in no more than 200 words, why you should get a parachute. \nSo we should just write about how great we are? Yes. \nI got my housekeeper pregnant and forced her leave the country, should I mention that? No, I wouldn't. \nAre you taking marks off for spelling mistakes? Only if we end up in a tie-break situation. \n- Who'll own the copyright? - What? Say if I was to survive and wanted to write my autobiography, could I use extracts or would you own the copyright? As far as I know, you own the copyright. \nBut the chances of us surviving are very low. \nRight. \nShould we not just have a bit of an old pray? Maybe God will help us and Anyway Have you all got pens and paper and everything? Can I use my laptop computer? I don't think you're allowed to. \nThey interfere with the radar. \nYes, but we're going to crash anyway. \nRight, I see what you mean. \nYes, use it. \nGo on, Dougal. \nGod, Ted, you're very calm altogether. \nHave you gone mad? No, it's just I've always hated flying. \nBut now we're in an emergency situation, all my fear has transformed itself into affirmative action. \n- Do you know what I mean? - I do. \n- Do you? - No. \nAll right, then. \nPens down. \nFather O'Shea, you didn't stop writing. \nYou're disqualified. \nWhat? That's not fair, I was only finishing. \nFather Cave, do you want to go first? I haven't written this down because it comes from the heart. \nFather Gallagher, I've known you and been your friend for many years. \nAnd now I think it's important to say I love you. \nI love you more than anybody I've ever loved. \nI don't want the parachute. \nGive it to him! (Sobbing) Right. \nWell done, Father Cave. \n(Sighing) (Ted) Father Fay? (Clearing throat) (Gibbering) That's very good. \nWell, beat that. \nJoe. \nWell, uh, I think I should get the parachute because I'm great. \nIn fact, I think I should get both of them in case one doesn't work. \nOoh, not a popular one, Joe. \nFather Flynn, what did you write? I haven't written anything because I'm not very good at that kind of thing. \nBut I did a drawing. \nRight. \nWell, can we have a look? - What do you think? - (Ted) Well, er It's me, in the nip. \nWith a dog. \nHow does that help you win a parachute? What do you mean parachute? I wasn't listening at the start there. \nWhy would I want a parachute? The plane's in trouble. \nThere's a competition to see who gets a parachute. \nOh. \nOk. \nFather Jack, you next. \nFather Jack? Where's Father Jack? The parachutes. \nThe parachutes have gone. \nAh, Ted, I just remembered that we're all going to die. \nDougal, I just wanted to say I know sometimes I'm a little short with you, sometimes I'm not as patient as I should be. \nBut you know, in the end we're the best of friends. \n- What do you mean? - Well I'm just trying to say I know sometimes I act like you get on my nerves, but secretly I think it's quite funny. \nWhat's funny? You know, the way you mix things up and sometimes you don't get what's going on. \nWho are you talking about again? - You. \n- What about me? (Sighing) I'm just trying to say, Dougal - I like you. \n- Thanks very much. \n- Who are you saying that to? - You! I just said it! Hey! We're on a plane! Father, do you know what a section tubing stabiliser dart is? - No. \n- A shell diversifier E-420? - No. \n- A jet-wrench 3-ply shortstick? - No. \n- Who am I? - You're the pilot. \n- Great. \nI know what I did there. \nI started too big. \nFather, do you know what a fuel reserve is? I'd imagine it's a basic back-up to the main fuel tanks. \nThat's exactly it. \nNow, we have a fuel reserve, but the line connecting it to the - the thing on the wing - Engine. \nThe engine, yes. \nThat line is broken. \nIf we could somehow fix that line, we might stand a chance. \nEven sticky tape would do, but there's none on the plane. \nThat's where you're wrong. \nDougal, give us the thing you bought there. \nAll your problems are over. \nI wouldn't make any calls, it interferes with the radar. \nDougal! The sticky tape. \nBrilliant. \nNow all you have to do is climb onto the wheels, and attach the line. \n- Then we're saved? - Yes. \nI just climb out of the plane and Hang on. \n- I climb out of the plane? - Yes. \nI wouldn't trust anybody else. \nYou can keep a level head. \n- Then I'll do it. \n- But Ted! Dougal, I love all this. \nWhen everything's Ok I imagine terrible things happening and now that one has actually happened, it's just a rush. \nI feel fearless, like Jeff Bridges in that movie. \n- I haven't seen that one. \n- Not many have, Dougal. \nAnyway, let's go, Captain. \nFather, I'm not a Captain. \nAnd I don't climb under planes to fix fuel lines. \nI think from now on, we're anything we want to be. \nCan I still be a priest? - You're a very brave man. \n- I'm just doing a job. \nDougal, the sticky tape. \nWell, I'd better get back to the cockpit. \nGood luck, Father Ted. \n(Sticky tape unrolling) 'You have used three inches of sticky tape. \nGod bless you. \n' (Tape unrolling) 'You have used four inches of sticky tape. \nGod bless you. \n'You have used 11 and two-eighths inches of sticky tape. \n'God bless you. \n' (Ted) Ah, shut up. \nWait! Dougal I think I've Yes! I've sealed up the line! - We're saved! - Oh, great! I've done it, Dougal! We're going to live! Everything's completely back to normal. \nIt's just your completely average common or garden aeroplane journey. \n(Ted screaming) What am I doing on the fecking wheel? ! (Screaming) Oh, right. \nRight. \nThanks very much. \nWell, still no sign of Father Jack. \nOh, I hope he's all right. \nAnd Father Crilly. \nI hate seeing him like this. \n(Dougal) Ah, he's beginning to loosen his grip now. \nAnyway, would you like a sandwich? I cut them into the shape of an aeroplane. \nNo thanks, Mrs Doyle. \nTed and me have had enough of aeroplanes to do us a lifetim.\nHaven't we, Ted? (Jack) Drink! Feck! Arse! Drink! Feck! Arse! Drink! Feck! Arse! Drink! Ahh! Drink! Drink! Arse! (Screaming) Drink! Drink! Drink! Feck! Arse! (Sobbing) (Gibbering and sobbing) Drink! Drink! Drink! (Sobbing) (Gasping) Drink! Drink! (Continues shouting and sobbing) 'This is your pilot speaking. \nThe emergency is over. \n'We will be landing in 20 minutes."

      "What about Tuesday? Can you do the 11 o'clock Mass? Ted, I'll do the 11 and the 12, you should have a rest after that weekend away. \nWell, Paris does tend to take it out of m.\nI'm off for a game. \nTed, care to join me? No, thanks, Darren. \nWhat time are we going to the races? I suppose after lunch. \nOh, and Mrs Dunne hopes you like pheasant. \nI love pheasant. \nThis is what it's all about. \nFine port, beautiful surroundings and intelligent company. \nDid you not have all that at your last parish? No. \nDublin seems to suit you, though. \nYou've got a new-found gleam in your eye. \nYes, I'll be staying here a while, as long as I don't mess it up by doing something stupid. \nMost of these accounts seem in order, Father Smith, but could I ask Father Crilly about one or two of these things he's put down under \"expenses\"? TED! (Helicopter) (Squeaking and whirring) What is making that incredibly annoying noise? Ronaldo. \nI was lonely without you, Ted, so I got a hamster instead. \nYes, but does he ever stop running in that fecking wheel? No, he's had to use it ever since he rode this into his feed tray. \nDon't worry, I think there's just something wrong with the brakes. \nHow long has Father Jack been living in there? He started just a few days after you left. \nMaybe he's agoraphobic. \nJack scared of fighting? I don't think so, Ted. \n(Rumbling) (Screaming) Mrs Doyle just fell off the roof. \nI think I'll go and visit Father Fitzpatrick. \nI think he has a book belonging to me. \nLet's see now, Humanae Vitae. \nYou know, sometimes I leaf through this to see just how far we've come. \nCelebration Of The Christian Mystery, Daeus Canida, Ventra Mepolo Ah, Stephen king's The Shining. \nWell, thanks for the tea, Father. \nSee you the next time we, um We, uh Sorry, Father, I hope you don't mind me asking but what have you got a padlock on that door for? Is there something top secret? - My collection. \n- Yes! That's right. \n- What is it? War memorabilia? - That's right. \nLike a look? I'd love to. \nTaken from the German advance on Russia. \nYou can see where the hammer hits the shell casing. \nGosh, that's interesting. \nUh, these are helmets, mostly infantry. \nYes, these would be German as well? That's right. \nNothing from the Allied side? No, that sort of thing wouldn't interest me at all. \n(Ted) Right. \nThat's my curiosity satisfied. \nAnd this is the last photograph taken of Herr Hitler. \nHe's signing a few death warrants. \nFunny, how you get more right wing as you get older. \nRight, well Great, this is all wonderful stuff. \nSome people aren't too sure but you seem genuinely interested. \nOh, I amgenuinely interested. \n- Ahh! Was ist das?! - What are you doing here?! I told you! No sleeping here. \nThis is an old friend, Ted. \nSee you. \n(Man ) # Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles # (Chimes ) Feck! - (Chimes ) - Arse! - (Chimes ) - Drink! Ted, the table's so dirty I can write me name in it. \nThere's a \"G\" in Dougal. \nWhere? Right, that's it. \nI'm fed up living in filth. \nWe'll just have to clean this place. \nAnd what if anyone saw that hole in your tank top? Where, Ted? Ah, God, would you look at that! And this here. \nA perfectly square bit of black dirt on the window. \nHow could you get a perfectly square bit of black dirt on a window? Mrs Doyle can't do any cleaning since she fell off the roof. \n(Screaming) See? She can't keep her balance at all. \nThat's it, then, I'll just have to say it. \nWe'll have to clean this place ourselves. \nWhat? - Are you with me, Dougal? - Well, yeah. \nRight, let's go! Let's clean this mother! Yeah! Ted, I could pick up that broken bit of lamp. \nGood idea. \nWow. \nI'm bored now. \nYeah. \nDougal, look. \nOhh! Ho-ohh! I am Chinese if you please! Come on, Dougal, lighten up. \nUhh Wh Wh Who Dougal, there were Chinese people there! Oh, right, yeah. \nBut they I mean What is I mean That's the Yin family, they live in Chinatown. \nChinatown? There's a Chinatown on Craggy Island? I wouldn't have done a Chinaman impression if I'd known there was a Chinaman there to see. \nWhy not, Ted? (Whispers ) Because because it's racist. \nThey'll think I'm a racist. \nI'll have to explain I'm not a racist. \nIf I don't stretch my eyes like that from time to time, I get \"Fat Eyes\". \n- (Revs engine ) - Ahh! It's nothing of a racial nature! Thanks for being so understanding! Right, that's that. \nOh, that's that, all right. \nWhat's that? I ordered some new stuff for the house, get rid of this old tat. \nDougal, you don't think I upset those Chinese people? I don't know. \nIt was like when you did that impression of Stephen Hawking. \nHe was the last person you'd expect to turn up. \nThat was a million to one shot. \nGod, he can move in that wheelchair when he's angry. \nDon't worry about it, Ted. \nDid you phone Habitat? No, Habit Hat. \nLike Habitat it sells soft furnishings but also priest clothes. \nDoes it not get confused with Habitat? No, that's never happened, except when you just did it. \nAnyway, what else did you order? Priest's socks, really black ones. \nI read in an article about priest's socks that priest's socks are blacker than any other socks. \nThat's right. \nSometimes you see lay people wearing apparently black socks but if you look closely, they're really very, very, very, very dark blue. \nThat's true. \nI thought my Uncle Tommy was wearing black socks but when I looked at them closely, they were just very, very, very, very, very, very, dark blue. \nNever buy black socks in a normal shop. \nThey'll shaft you every time. \n(Man ) Hello there, Father! Hello, Colm. \n- Out and about? - I am. \nSame as yourself. \nGood, good. \nI hear you're a racist now, Father. \nWhat? How did you get interested in that? - Who said I'm a racist? - Everyone's saying it, Father. \nShould we all be racists? What's the official line the Church is taking? No, no Only the farm takes up most of the day and at night I just like a cup of tea. \nI might not be able to devote myself full time to the old racism. \n- Good for you, Father! - What? Oh, Mrs Carberry. \nGood for you! Someone had the guts to stand up to them at last! Coming over here, taking our jobs and our women and acting like they own the fecking place! Well done, Father! Good for you! Good for you! I'd like to fecking - Fecking Greeks! - It's the Chinese he's after! I'm not after the Chinese! I don't care as long as I can have a go at the Greeks! They invented gayness! Look, we're not having a go at anybody! I'm not a racist, all right?! God. \nFeckin' Greeks! - How's Mary? - Fine. \nShe got that job. \nGreat! (Man ) Racist! (Irish music playing, chatter) (Silence ) (Rings ) - Hello? - Hello. \nIs that the Yin dynasty Family! Is that the Yin family? - This is Sean Yin. \n- Hello, it's Father Ted Crilly here. \nI think I owe you an apology. \n(Bell tinkling, tyres screech) Right, see you in a while. \nDougal, everything's cleared up. \nThey're coming straight round. \nI'll stop people saying I'm a racist. \nIt's great, nothing can go wrong. \nFantastic. \nSo the story is you're not a racist. \nYes. \nWhat? No, it's not a story. \nI am not a racist. \nTea, everyone. \nFather Crilly, I hear you're a racist. \nNo, Mrs Doyle, he's not a racist. \nI am not! I am not a racist! Mrs Doyle, you can't go on like this. \n- I'm going to try something. \n- No! - Don't worry. \n- Oh, nono! - No, no! - Just relax. \nNo (Screams ) Ohh Oh, yes, that's much better. \n- Are you sure? You look - Oh, yes, yes, yes! This is great. \nI'll be fine now, Father. \nNO! Seriously, Father, I feel 20 years younger. \nTed, the Chinese are coming. \nOh, where are they? Feck it, this big mark's still on the window. \nNever mind. \nHello! Hello! Why do we have to talk to this fascist? Come on now, it may have just been Where are they going? I invite them here and they don't let me tell them my side of the story! (Inaudible ) This is terrible, people think I'm a Nazi racist and I'm not! What can I do? Ted, here's an idea right off the top of my head. \nI haven't thought it through but what the hell, I'll just talk and see what comes out. \nAnyway Have a special event celebrating Craggy Island's different cultures and then people won't think you're a big racist. \n- My God - What? - That's a good idea. \n- No, it isn't. \nIt is, Dougal, it is! No, there's probably something wrong with it. \nThink it through. \nNo, Dougal, you've had a brilliant idea. \nBut break it down for me a bit more. \nWhat would an event celebrating the different cultures be like? What? What would it involve? Celebration, yes, but what form could it take? Ted, I want out. \n- What do you mean? - I went too far too soon. \nI didn't know what I was getting into, Ted. \nI didn't know you had to follow up a good idea with loads more. \nI'm sorry, Ted, I'm going to sleep in the spare room. \n- Dougal! - I'm sorry! I've sheltered you for 50 years, you've never even made me tea. \n(German accent) You make the tea, I do the washing up. \nWhen did you do the washing up? I did it for the whole of 1947! And again in 1973. \nYou liar! You broke all the plates and then went, \"I am so tired, I never had to wash up in the Wehrmacht. \n\" - Never! - I'm going to take a Valium. \n- Me too. \n- Why must you ape everything I do? Wait! These aren't Valium! These are the cyanide we kept for emergencies! You put cyanide next to the Valium, that's asking for trouble! - Shut up. \n- We've only got 15 seconds to live! - That is just fine by me. \n- Good. \nFine by me too. \n- Good, I'm glad it is. \n- I'm glad you're glad. \nHoly Mary Mother of God, Jesus and His Blessed Saints. \nOh, Holy Mary I'm cured! What happened, Mrs Doyle? I stepped on the hamster's bike and fell down the stairs. \nDougal, I told you to put that away safely. \nI did, Ted. \nI put it back in the cage. \nOh, no, no. \nDon't worry, Father. \nIt's great, I feel fantastic. \nI'd forgotten I can turn my head right around like this! That stuff from Habit Hat arrives today so when it comes give Father Jack Where is Jack? - I think he's up the chimney. \n- Right - Will I burn him out? - No! The smoke would back up, it'd be all over the house. \nAnyway, when that stuff comes, put it all up, all the new rugsand the things for the chairs and It's your thing really. \nI wouldn't know about that because I'm a man. \nAnyway, we're off to celebrate Craggy Island's ethnic diversity. \n( # Carl Douglas: kung Fu Fighting) (Applause ) Welcome. \nWillkommen. \nBienvenu. \nIt's a great honour and privilege for me to present this celebration of the diverse cultures that exist on Craggy Island. \nNamely, Chinese people and people from Craggy Island. \nI've prepared a short slide presentation which reflects this multicultural mix. \nSo, without further ado let's start the show. \nHe visited the Island a few years ago, I forget his name now but I got on very well with him. \nI just thought I'd throw that in. \nWill there be any free drink at this? Yes, a limited supply of free drink afterwards. \nThe Great Wall Of China, a miracle of Chinese engineering. \nSo big you can see it from anywhere in the world. \nChairman Mao, secretary of the Communist Party of China, the world's biggest Communist party, and in my view, the best. \nMr Miyagi from The karate kid. \nMy favourite film, not because of the karate kid, but because of Mr Miyagi. \nEvery day, I remember some of his many words of wisdom. \nkato! Where would he spring from next? The Maori. \nI'm sorry, I don't know how that got in there. \nOf course, there are no Maoris on Craggy Island. \nMing the Merciless. \nAnd best of all, the Chinese people themselves. \nLook at them, aren't they great? The Chinese. \nA great bunch of lads. \nI think we've addressed all aspects of Chinese culture and I'd like to thank you all for coming here tonight and if you'd like to, we can have a bit of an old chat. \nWell, the slide show was a big pile of crap. \nBut the free drink very much appreciated. \nThank you, Father Crilly. \nI just wanted to clear things up. \nI'm not a fascist, I'm a priest. \nFascists dress in black and tell people what to do, whereas priests - More drink! - (Cheers ) Er, anywhere there. \nWould you like a cup of tea? No, thanks. \nI have an allergic reaction to it. \nIt's very rare. \nIf I drink tea, there's a 70% chance I'll die. \nI'll make you a cup anyway in case you change your mind. \nNo. \nThanks anyway. \nTo China! (Cheers ) To Craggy Island! (Cheers ) - More drink! - (Cheers ) Sorry, the bar's closed. \n(Cheers ) Everyone come back to my place for a drink. \n(Cheers ) I need the toilet first. \n(Cheers ) (Cheers ) Mrs Doyle, we have guests. \nDid that stuff arrive? Yes, and I put it all up in less than an hour. \n- There was this letter. \n- Letter? \"Father Crilly, on the instructions \"of our recently deceased client, Father Seamus Fitzpatrick, \"here are some items he specified you should have \"in the event of his death. \n\" (Bell tinkling) I can explain everything. \nActually, no, I can't. \n(Telephone rings ) - Hello? - Uh, sorry again and have you opened that present yet? No, looking forward to it though. \nA year's supply of whisky! How very generous! Yes, the problem there is, you see, there's been a change of plan."

      "- Hello, Fargo. \n- Oh, Hud, Giant, hello. \nChris is looking great for the competitio.\nThanks, lads. \nFather Crilly, hello there! Fargo, ha ha. \nHow's the champ? He's grea.\nA few quid on him, Father? I've put the entire annual heating allowance on him. \nBut what if he doesn't win, Father? Well, we won't have any heating but if it stays as warm as the summer we're laughing! But come on, it's Chris - he's the champ! Talk about a safe bet! Have you heard about this creature going around terrorising sheep on the island? N.\nTell me more. \nThey say it's as big as a jaguar. \nThe car? No, the big cat thing! And its face is all teeth, big white teeth as sharp as knives. \n- Has it killed yet? - No, but it's only a matter of time. \nHope it doesn't get my sheep. \nNo man's sheep is saf.\nOh, dear! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! - Ohhhh!! - Oohhhhh!!! (Giant) 'Has it killed yet?' (Hud) 'It's only a matter of time 'big white teeth as sharp as knives. \n- 'Ohhhh' - (Howl) (Silence ) (Birds singing) (Tin cans rattling) (Gunfire ) Dougal, give the album a rest. \nTed, come on, it's brilliant. \nI think people will give up pop music and listen to this instead. \nWhat I hear in the charts, I'm not sure if that's not happening already. \nWhat? This is so good though, Ted! There's all kinds of things. \nLike magic I can create a big crowd of invisible ducks. \n(Train whistle ) Or take you on a trip into darkest Africa. \n(Toilet flushing) Or bring you into a spooky castle on a stormy night. \n(Telephone ringing) Oooh! Whooo! Craggy Island parochial house, Father Ted Crilly speaking. \n- F-F-Father! - Fargo? F-Father, can you come over quick?! Certainly, Fargo, what's the? (Click and dialling tone ) I'm going out Dougal, something's up with Fargo. \nMrs Doyle, you look terrible, doesn't she? Awful, Ted. \nI didn't get much sleep, Father. \nI kept thinking I heard this terrible howling noise. \n- That'd be the beast. \n- What's this, now? There's something terrible on the moors, Father. \n(Spooky music) Moors? We don't have any moors. \nWell, there's something terrible roaming around where normally there would be moors, Father! They think it might be a kind of giant fox! (Thunder crashes ) - Dougal! - Sorry. \nIt couldn't be Jack, could it? Someone might mistake him for a big mad cat. \nDon't forget, during leap years Jack is very much affected by the changing of the seasons. \nFor a short while, he is at one with nature. \nHe's great when he's in the mood. \nIf only it lasted longer. \n(Vomits ) I better go and make some tea. \n(Slurping and gurgling in time with Mrs Doyle's footsteps ) I told you to turn that off. \nBut it is off. \n(Slurping and gurgling continues ) What do you mean, Chris isn't in the competition? He's the champ! This talk of the beast has got to him, his nerves are shot. \nI took a photo this morning. \nNerves? It's a sheep! He always had a very artistic temperament. \nHe's not a concert pianist, he's a sheep! I don't see how (Ted) Oh, my God. \nI mean, when you compare it with what he looked like last year It's like two completely different sheep. \nHe's off his food He's not sleeping And he's started to burp. \n(Sobbing) Oh, F-Father, w-what am I going to do? Fargo, pull yourself together. \nChris needs you now more than ever. \nCome on, I want to see him. \nBut he doesn't want to see anybody, Father! Fargo, that's an order. \nTake me to see Chris, the unhappy sheep. \nGod, you should have seen him, he's just a shadow of a sheep. \nIf I was a sheep, I'd be watching my back right now. \nWhy? Because of the beast. \nThey say it's as big as four cats and it's got a retractable leg so as it can leap up at you better. \nAnd it lights up at night, Ted, and it's got four ears, two are for listening and two are back-up ears, and for some reason it's got a tremendous fear of stamps! Mrs Doyle says it's got magnets so if you're made of metal it'll stick to you, and instead of a mouth it's got four arses. \nDougal! It's a legend, it doesn't exist. \nRight, like the Phantom of the Opera doesn't exist. \nThe Phantom of the Opera doesn't exist! Don't start another what-does-exist debate. \nAdd those last two examples to the chart. \n- But - Dougal! I'm more worried about that bet I put on Chris. \n- You don't think he'll win? - No burping sheep has ever won. \nWhat about Big Brendan in 1983? Fluke. \nAnyway, it's just the heating budget. \nAnd look what the Weather News says. \nThat's last year's Weather News. \n- What? - This is this year's. \nI'll see if John and Mary will give me my money back. \nI'll come too, see if they've got Sound Effects Volume Five. \nFair enough. \nGood night, Dougal. \n(Howling) And some of his ears are inside his head, and his yawn sounds like Liam Neeson chasing a load of hens (Ted) Hello, Fargo. \nAnd he doesn't have any eyebrows, except on Saturdays. \nOh! Ahh! And you can stay in there till you learn some fecking manners! (Mary ) Let me out, you bastard! (Banging) And I've thrown away the key! How do you like that, huh? Hello, John. \nHello, Father Crilly! - Hello, Father McGuire! - (Banging stops ) Where'swhere's Mary? She's away at her mother's. \n(Banging) No! Is there, um, is there someone in the cupboard? (Mary ) Hello, Fathers. \nMary? Mary, I forgot you were there, I thought you were at your mother's. \n(Mary ) No, I didn't go after all. \nI'm in the cupboard. \nWhat are you doing in there? It's because of the beast, I thought Mary would be safer in the cupboard. \n(Mary ) I'm better off here. \nWhat can I do you for, Father? A pack of 20 Carols. \n(Mary ) Certainly, Father. \nI'll get them, love. \nYou stay there. \nEr, John, can I have a word? (Mary ) Is Father McGuire there? I am. \nHello, Mary. \n(Mary ) Lovely day, isn't it? Oh, yes. \n(Mary ) You're looking great, anyway. \nI'm sorry, Father, a bet's a bet. \nBut if she doesn't have the operation she won't be able to fetch water for her village. \nI am sorry, Father. \nYou should've waited, the odds have lengthened to 20-1 on account of Chris's nervous troubles. \n- Anyway, your cigarettes. \n- Thanks. \nThey don't have the sound effects album. \nWe might as well just go. \n(Mary ) Bye, Fathers. \n- Bye! - Bye! - (Mary ) I hope you're satisfied. \n- Ahh, shut up! Oof! Look, there's Giant Reed. \nHello, Giant! What are you thinking, Ted? Look at the big serious look on your face. \nChris can't win this competition. \nTed, it's pointless thinking about it. \nThere's nothing we can do about the situation. \nWe just have to accept the fact and that's that. \nWe could bring Chris over here, that might help. \nOh, wow! Brilliant! I knew there was something we could do! Didn't I say it? No. \nNo, you didn't. \nYou said the exact opposite. \nWe couldn't do anything. \nTed, you've done this before, so I took the liberty of taping the conversation. \nWe'll just have a listen. \n'Ted, it's pointless even thinking about it. \n'There's nothing we can do about the situation. \n'We just have to accept the fact and that's that. \n' I stand corrected. \n(Baaing) Oh Ahh There he is now. \n(Burps ) I'm still not sure about this, Father. \nWe'll make him into a new sheep. \nOr else a jumper and a few chops! (Laughs ) I'm terribly sorry, that was just tasteless. \nI'll be off, then. \nOk. \nSeriously, if there's one place for peace and quiet (Jack) Feck! Arse! Feck! (Banging and crashing) Feck! Feck! Feck! Arse (Muttering) It would be an insult to you if I finished that sentence. \nYou're up early, Father. \nWe're off to get Chris into shape for the competition. \nDo you think would our new guest like a cup of tea? The little sheep fellow? I don't think they drink tea. \nNot unless you have some special \"Sheep Tea\". \nYes. \n- What? - I do have some sheep tea. \nOh, right Well, um Give him some of that, then. \nOk, so. \nIt's nearly midday, do we have to get up this early? Has to be done, Dougal. \nWe've got to get Chris from looking like this to looking like this. \n( # M-People: Search For The Hero Inside Yourself #) # You've got to search for the hero inside yourself # Search for the secrets you hide # Search for the hero inside yourself # Until you find the key to your life # Search for the hero inside yourself, yeah, yeah # Search for the secrets you hide # Ah, hello, Father. \nDid you? Is he? I'm sorry, we tried everything. \nAh, well, I suppose II I better take him home. \nA-ha! - Ha! - A-ha! Got you! - What did you do?! - Just did my best. \nI don't know what to say. \nCan I buy you a drink to celebrate? Dougal, don't let Chris wander off. \n- And keep that front door closed. \n- Ok, Ted. \nHe's the bestfecking sheep ever. \nHis little sheep face And you have to say, great sense of humour. \nReally? Great. \nHe only cost 23 - 23! A clause says I have to pay more if his image is used on stamps, but still, a great bargain for such a happy sheep. \n(Sighs ) (Laughing) - Is that Hud Hastings? - Yeah. \nIs hewearing a crown? (Laughing) Yes, very good, yes. \n(Drunk and laughing) Very good, yes. \nYes, bye! Dougal, I notice the front door is wide open. \nOh, er, it is, yes, Ted. \nAnd I see we're currently sheepless. \nOh Ahhh! I told you to keep the door closed. \nNow, hold it there, Ted. \n(Ted) 'Don't let him wander off' (Howling) - What's that? - The beast! Come on! How do we know which way to go? Sheep, like all wool-bearing animals, travel north, where it's colder and they won't be so stuffy. \nSo, we have to go north. \nWhich way is north? - I-I don't know. \n- (Howling) Quick! It seems to be coming from all around us. \nThe Sioux Indians could pinpoint the exact location of buffalo by looking at the moon and putting their ears to the ground. \nTed, maybe it's coming from that stereo. \n(Howling) - (Burp ) - Ted! It's Chris! Is he all right? He's fine! He must've realised it was a big stereo in a tree! Let's bring him home, Dougal. \nI think I'm beginning to figure out what's been going on. \nWell, it's been an easy decisio.\nThere's one out-and-out winner and rather than waste time with a speech I'll get on with the job of announcing the winner who, today, has come first in this competition to see who the winner is in the king of the Sheep competition that we have all come to today wondering who indeed will it be, who wins the prize of king of the Sheep. \nThe winner of this year's king of the Sheep competition is - Stop! - (All gasp ) Good God! What is the meaning of this? This competition is a sham and a fraud and asham! What?! How dare you! There's been a deliberate and scurrilous attempt to sabotage this high-profile sheep competition. \nAnd those responsible are in this very room. \n- Giant Reed and Hud Hastings! - (Shocked gasps ) - (Man ) Fuckin' hell! - You'd better have some proof. \nOh, I do, I do. \nYou constantly chatted of the so-called beast of Craggy Island, always within hearing distance of Chris. \nFargo, how's the champ? (Baaing) And you used a copy of BBC Sound Effects Volume Five to add weight to those fanciful claims. \nAn impressionable sheep could not but be convinced by \"Terrible Monster\". \nIs this true? Well, well, well. \nWhat a pretty picture Father Crilly has painted! How dare you bring shame on this celebration of sheep! Don't be too hard on them - sorry, your name? - Ala.\n- Don't be too hard on them, Alan, they were simply pawns. \nThe real villain in this piece has yet to be revealed. \nFargo Boyle! - What?! - (Shocked mutterings ) - (Man ) Fuckin' hell! - That's nonsense! I'll just go now and take my trophy. \nYou were disappointed at the poor odds Chris was receiving. \nYou manipulated those odds by sabotaging your own sheep and then staging a miraculous recovery. \nYou paid Giant and Hud to talk about the beast in front of Chris. \nHud, Giant, hello there! You didn't count on the vanity of your accomplices who used their wealth to buy a fur coat and a crown! And you bought the BBC Sound Effects record. \nYou knew that with my intuitive understanding of sheep, I could nurse him back to health. \nIt was you, Fargo, you, youyou! Chris! Chris, it's not true! It's not true! No, no! Don't look at me, don't look at me! (Sobbing) Should I call the police, Father? No. \nHe's lost the trust of his shee.\nThat's punishment enough for a farmer who deals primarily with sheep. \nIf you'll excuse me, there's a stench in here and I need some fresh air. \nTed, if Chris has been disqualified, haven't you lost the heating money on the bet? I know it's a radical step, but it's very, very cold. \nSee you in three months, then, Ted. \nActually, I'd better go to the toilet first."

      "- (Door slams ) - (Ted) Don't even talk to me! (Dougal) I'm so sorry, Ted. \n(Ted) You're judging a baby competition, don't get them agitated! This happens every time and I'm sick of it! I was just playing with them, Ted. \nPlaying? You were jumping up and down, running around and getting completely overexcited. \nThat's why you got sick on me! I thought the standard was rubbish. \nA lot of sloppy babies who looked as though they couldn't be bothered. \nAnd the hairiness of some of those babies. \nIt was a very hairy baby parade. \nIf people can't even shave their babies before they come out Normally you wouldn't have to shave a baby! What the hell? Mrs Doyle, did you put a brick in the middle of the floor? - I did. \n- Wellwhy? I thought it would be handy for your paperclips. \nYou can put them in that hollow there. \nYes, but why on the floor? I got the idea from a magazine. \nThat may be fine for Will Self or one of those fellas but I prefer the more traditional aspect of not putting bricks in the (Screams ) Mrs Doyle looks very different today. \nWas it definitely Mrs Doyle? (knock at door) I'm sorry, I was looking for Mrs Doyle. \nIt is Mrs Doyle! What? I thought you were Marilyn Monroe. \n(Screeching laugh) Now a couple of nice pints for you. \nOh, great. \nWe're a bit low, actually. \n(Milkman chuckles ) There's plenty more where that came from. \n(Screeching laugh) I shouldn't be here at all, the police are after me. \nThey're not! I'm so gorgeous they want to arrest me! (Screeching laugh) Actually, I'm a bit sad at the moment, Mrs Doyle. \n- I have to go to a funeral. \n- Oh, no, really? Yes. \nMy last girlfriend. \nShe died from exhaustion. \n(Very screeching laugh) - Hello. \n- Oh Hello, Father. \nThis is Pat Mustard, the new milkman. \n- Oh? - Yeah, just here on the south side, spreading meself around a bit. \nMrs Doyle, you need to dust Father Jack's room. \nAnd a cobweb in the shed needs removing. \nRighto so, Father. \nI'll be on my way, padre. \nOff on my rounds. \nRight, Ted. \nLooks like an ordinary blackboard, doesn't it? Yes. \nThat's what I thought - but watch this! You see? You can rub off the letters. \nWellyou can do that with every blackboard. \nWhat? This is very milky tea, Mrs Doyle. \nThis is almost all-milk tea. \nIs there any tea in here at all? Well No. \nAnyone would think you were trying to use up all the milk so that so that Pat Mustard can come here more often. \nHa ha ha ha. \nPat's very interesting, Father. \nAt the weekends he's a swimming instructor. \nAnd he fought in Vietnam and he's a former Mr Universe and he taught Elvis Presley how to play karate. \nIt sounds like he's telling you a few tall tales. \nWhat do you think, Dougal? Well, Ted, I'm very cynical, as you know. \nWell, Father it's not my place, I know, but it sounds to me like you're a little bit jealous. \nJealous? Of Mr Milkyman? I very much think not! What are you doing, Dougal? I'm looking at some of the hairy babies. \n- There's something about them. \n- Let's see. \n- Oh, my God. \n- What? This is a terrible thing to say but if you took this moustache, this baby's head hair and this baby's sideboards I think you'd getPat Mustard! Do you think the babies are copying his style? No, I think it's more likely thatmm-hmm. \nThat Pat Mustard has been You know, I mean delivering more than dairy products. \nNo! You mean he's been HoIcan't Ho! Ho-ho! Henowha He's been what? We should do some detective work, find out what this Pat Mustard fella's up to. \n(Mrs Doyle laughing) (Pat Mustard laughing) (Both laughing) (Coughs ) Hello, Father. \nOh, Pat wondered if he could put his massive tool in my box. \n- What?! How dare you! - It's too big for the milk float. \nI'll pick it up tomorrow. \nMrs Doyle, could you leave us? Righto, Father. \nPat Mustard, there are some very hairy babies around and I think you are the hairy baby maker! Well, I think you'd need proof if you're gonna make that sort of accusation and I'm a very careful man, Father, a very careful man. \nExcept when taking precautions in the bedroom! You wouldn't be advising the use of artificial contraception, Father, would you? Yes, I! No, I If you're going to be Iof course Just feck off! You'd want to get up very early to catch me, Father. \nVery early in the morning. \n(Camera clicking) And now to ride Mrs O'Reilly. \nDougal, did you get that? Ted, I turned the volume up to hear what's going on in the house. \n- At this level you could hear - (Horn honks ) Right, now we wait. \nNo, he's finished! God! Theresa, I forgot me fecking trousers! - Ha-ha! Mm-hm! - (Camera clicking) Shameful! Dear God, disgraceful. \n- Have you ever seen the like? - No, I have not. \nHow should we do this? How about 2 each for these and a tenner for the rest? I wasn't selling them, I was just showing you what one of your employees was up to. \nOh! Oh, my God, yes! What did you think? I completely misread the situation! This is disgraceful behaviour. \nThis employee shall be removed from his job straight away. \nThank you for informing us. \nHey, you, who's gonna deliver the milk now? Actually, next week is a big week. \nWe agreed to ease the milk surplus of Eastern Europe by buying 17,000 tonnes of milk from them. \nPat's sacking couldn't have come at a worse time. \nThink of all that lovely milk with no one to drop it off. \nI wish I could do it. \nWe could certainly trust a man of God. \nA what? - A priest. \n- Thanks for reminding me(!) But I'd love to be a milkman, that'd be fantastic. \nGod knows I do flip-all around here! You could certainly fill in for a while. \nI'm not sure. \nFather McGuire has other duties in the parish. \nLike what? - And be sure to keep warm. \n- Ted! Not in front of Mr Fox. \n- And stay on the left of the road. \n- Duh! I know! Stop it! That turns it on, that makes it go, that steers it. \n- Ok. \nRight. \n- Ok! You're ready to be a milkman. \nBetter get going - milk gets sour, you know. \nUnless it's UHT milk but there's no demand for that because it's shite. \n(Beeps horn ) He'll be fine. \n- (Clunk) - Ahh! What's going on? Father Hackett's got very fond of that brick. \nIt's a great pet. \nHe doesn't have to feed it or clean it. \nSuits him perfectly. \nI love my brick! Ahhh, that's nice. \nMaybe we're seeing another side to Father Jack, a more caring Ahh, feck it! Fed up with \"brick\"! (Telephone rings ) Craggy Island parochial house Father Ted Crilly speaking It's me, Father, y'ignorant bastard. \nIs that you, Mustard? You got me sacked and now I have to yank meself off because I haven't got any proper sex. \nWell, if you're going to use that language No, I've something to tell you. \nI've left a little surprise on the milk float your little friend took off me. \nSomething to remember me by. \n- A bomb! - What?! A very special bomb. \nWhen your little friend gets to over 4mph the bomb is armed but when he comes back under 4mph then (Imitates explosion ) Sorry, I lost you there. \nWhat happens? - It'll go off. \n- Oh, my God, Dougal! (Pat laughing evilly) Mrs Millettwo pints. \nTwo pints. \nTwo pints of milk. \n(Doorbell) Pat Father! Oh, my God! Two pints. \nEh, two pints two pints. \nThere you go. \nBye, then. \n(Doorbell) Morning, Mrs Gleason! (Screams ) Ok, right. \nI'll just leave it here. \n(Car horn honking) Dougal! Dougal! Are you going over 4mph?! I'm fine, leave me alone. \n- Are you doing over four?! - Not yet. \n(Click) Now I am. \nDougal, there's a bomb on the milk float! A bomb? Who's that for? It's not for delivery - it's going to kill you! Pat Mustard put it there! When you go under 4mph it'll explode! Have you got that?! Oh, God! I don't wanna be a milkman any more! Just don't slow down! Ted, look! It's a big bunch of boxes in the road! Just stay over four! (Beeps horn ) (Beeps horn ) Go, Dougal! Go, go, go! Get to the roundabout and circle it. \nI have to have a think! Ted! (Phone rings ) Barren Island parochial house. \nFather Beeching. \nDerek, Dougal's on a milk float with a bomb that will blow up if it goes under 4mph. \nYes, that is a problem. \nBut don't panic, Ted, we'll find a way through it. \nWe've got to do something practical! WaitI have it. \n(Engine chugging) The Lord be with you Oh, no! Mass! Mass today being offered for Father Dougal McGuire who finds himself in a trying and unfortunate situation. \nWe pray God will protect him from harm at thistime - and deliver him to safety. \n- Amen. \n(Pat laughing evilly) Oh, yes, they'll be peeling him off the wall for weeks to come. \nGo in peace to love and serve the Lord (All) Amen. \nDougal, there's a roundabout! Just keep driving round! - Everything's gonna be Ok! - But I get dizzy! Don't get dizzy! You've got to come up with a plan. \nBack to my house! ( # Tense music) - That's the idea? - It's the best we've had. \nAnother Mass - that's our best idea? I thought the other one went very well. \nDougal needs help, not a Mass! This isn't a time for Mass, this is a time for action! Is there anything to be said for saying another Mass? Just a small one? Oh, God, I love saying Mass. \nHim and his Masses! One time, er, a few years ago, at the Moscow Olympics with, er, Sean Drea, the rower. \nThis is a great story. \n- We don't have time! - It won't take a second. \nShut up and help me think of a practical solution. \nTea for everyone! Father Beeching, biscuit or cake? Biscuit or cake? Ooh Biscuit or cake, let's see - For God's sake, hurry up! - Biscuit. \nNo, cake! Have you seen the damage a bomb can do? Blow your face off! Well, it worked for them and they saved hundreds of lives. \nWe only have to save one. \nThat was different, The Towering Inferno was a building that caught fire! It's not the same as rescuing a priest from an explosive milk float. \nAnd besides, they had Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. \nGod Almighty, I forgot Steve McQueen was in it. \nWait! I've got it! The Poseidon Adventure! - What? - Gene Hackman plays a priest in it. \n(Poseidon Adventure title music plays on TV) Well, that was no help. \nHe didn't even say Mass. \nLet's go to the roundabout and think of something there. \nOh! Fecking brick! Wait a minute, I've got an idea. \nYes, gentlemen Father Dougal is propelling the milk float by exerting a small amount of pressure on the accelerator. \nIf we replace his foot with an object then we can safely remove him from the vehicle. \nYou mean Yes. \nWe put the brick on the accelerator. \n- Dougal! - Ahh! - I've got a plan. \n- Ted, I want to be a priest again. \nThis isn't really your thing, is it? No, I don't like this job at all! All right, when I say step off, you step off, all right? k eep saying, \"I want to be a priest. \n\" I want to be a priest, I want to be a priest, I want to be a priest, I want to be a priest! Step off the milk float, Dougal! Ted, you forgot your brick! Put it back! Put it back! Run, Dougal! I'm a priest! (Laughing evilly) Oh, yes, you messed with the wrong milkman, Father. \nWell, I'm off. \nBetter get out the earplugs, Father, because when that milk float goes up, they'll hear it all the way to the North P (Distant rumbling) (Dialling tone ) - There y'are. \n- Thanks, Ted. \nSure you don't want any milk? No, no, I'll stay off milk for a good long while. \nYou stick to what you're good at and I'm good at being a priest. \nUh, yes. \nTed, it's scary out there in the real non-priest world. \nNot every job's as dangerous as being a milkman. \n- Anyway, good night. \n- Good night, Ted. \nThose women were in the nip!"

Which episode of One Foot In The Grave? Eh? You've just watched it. \nDon't you remember anything? I don't believe it! That's what he says. \nCome on, hurry up, we're off to the mainland. \nHurray!

No, Father. \nYou misunderstand. \n- She was robbed. \nThey stole her. \n- Oh, I see. \nTerrible when an old person can't walk the street without being stolen. \nIt is. \nCome on, Dougal. \nI don't want any accidents. \nThere's Mrs Dineen, Father. \nYou can drop me off here. \nRight so. \n- Hello, Father Crilly. \n- Hello, Mrs Dineen. \n(Mrs Doyle ) We'll go to the tea shop for a bit of a chat. \nRight so. \nBye now. \nGod, Dougal, imagine spending any more time with those tw. \n. \n(Brakes screech) Oh, 200 big ones, Dougal! What? Oh, God, Ted. \nI'm so happy. \nThe sun's out and we're in an opticians. \nIt doesn't get any better than this. \nGod, Ted! I just remembered. \nI forgot to have any breakfast. \n( # Dramatic music) We'll get something later, don't worry. \nOh, God, Ted, I'm so hungry. \nThere's no chance I couldn't die, could I? From the hunger? I don't think so. \nNot for a few hours. \nI'm finished now, Father. \nWell, I must say, I'm confused. \nHis eyesight is better then ever before. \nHe read right to the last line and even I can't see that one. \nAhI think I know what happened. \nFather Jack has a fondness for saying that word. \nOh, I didn't know. \nI've not used that chart before. \nI got it free with a crate of Carlsberg. \nDo you have anything to eat? Chips or a burger or a few chops? I'm out of my head with the hunger. \nNo. \nI'll, er, just get the other chart. \nSo, what happened to his last glasses? No idea. \nHe went out of the house for a few minutes and they were gone! (Ted) Dougal, you forgot your scarf. \n(Bird squawking) Fathers, this will take some time. \nOh, we'll head off. \nCome on, we'll go to the caves. \nHurray! Now, this chart is from Slovakia's premiere lens manufacturers, Feck Arse Industries. \nYou remember Mrs kiernan? Well, she was shopping the other day and a man came over to her and killed her and stole her pen! killed her? Well, they think so. \nThey're keeping her in for tests. \nWell, you know what happened to Mr Sweeney? Some fellas broke into his house and started messing with him and they put a bra on him. \nOh, God, poor Mr Sweeney. \nHe wouldn't like that at all. \nI heard there were involving Mr Sweeney last year. \nOh, it's terrible. \nWhat's the world coming to? Steady, Dougal. \nRight, one more. \nSteady. \nGod Almighty! Look who it is! It's that actor. \n- Who? - The man from One Foot In The Grave, - the \"I don't believe it\" man! - Oh, wow! (Ted) That's amazing. \nLook at him. \n- Do you know what he'd love? - What? If somebody went up and said his catchphrase. \nYeah! He'd love that. \nYou should definitely do that. \n- Should I? - I'd say no one ever does that! He'll think you're hilarious. \nThis is one of these times when I'm absolutely sure it's the right thing. \nI can safely say you definitely, definitely won't regret doing that. \n- I'm going to do it! - Brilliant! - Will I? - Yeah! Go on! Hold the camera. \nI don't believe it! (Wilson ) I'll bloody well kill you! Well, what did he say? Did he laugh? No, no, no, not really. \nI'm going to sit down now. \nOh, God, no! I could never be one of those have-a-go heroes. \nI didn't know my own strength. \nI heard his arm snap then it was just a case of lying on top of him until the filth arrived. \nWe'd better be off, Mrs Doyle. \nI'll get this. \nOh, no, Mrs Dineen. \nI'll get this. \nNo, now don't be silly. \nI'll pay. \nYou won't! Put that away. \nNow, don't be stupid, Mrs Doyle. \nNo, no, no, no! Now, just put your money away. \nYou're mad! No, no, no, no. \n(Crow screeching, Jack shouting) Fecking birds again. \nDrink! Take the money! Take the money! (Both shouting and screaming) Get off! - I'm writing a cheque. \n- No, you're not! - I am. \n- Give me that cheque book! Hello, police? (Chatter) (Man ) We understand. \nThenI was drinking over a pint of vodka a day. \nYes! Yes. \nAll I could think about was where to get the next drink. \nDrink! I didn't give a damn about my wife or kids. \nNah! Now, with all of your help, I'm coming through it. \nI'm just taking it one day at a time. \n(Group ) That's good. \nThank you, Ronald. \nNow, I notice we have a new member with us today. \nFather? Would you like to tell us your story? Drink! Drink! - Drink! - We hear you. \nLet it all out. \nDrink! It's so true. \nSo true This rock here is granite. \n- How long has that been there? - Oh, many millions of years. \nReally? As long as that? That is fascinating. \nHow come all the rocks are different sizes? Well, you knowrocks are generally different sizes. \nWow! I'm finding out all kinds of new things about rocks. \nOf course, at this time, most of the area was under water. \n- How did everyone breathe? - They had some sort of apparatus. \nRight. \nWow! Look at that rock over there. \nThis is the oldest part of our tour. \nThis cave was formed Wow. \nI don't believe it. \nYou again. \nGet out of it. \nI never want to see you again. \nBastard! That path's not open to the Mr Wilson, could I say how sorry I am. \nThat's all right. \nI just don't want to hear that bloody catchphrase. \n(Thinks ) 'I don't believe it! 'I don't believe it!!' I'm sure we came in this way. \nTed, I'm so hungry I'm beginning to hallucinate. \nDon't exaggerate. \nAnd stop worrying, we'll get out of here in no time. \nLet's try this way. \n- (Ghostly wail) - Ted, what's that? - What's what? - Oooooh! Ted! # I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouch, Scaramouch # Will you do the fandango? # Thunderbolt and lightning Very very frightening # Me # Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo # Galileo, Figaro, magnifico-o-o-o # I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me # He's just a poor boy from a poor family # Save him his life from this monstrosity # Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah! No! # We will not let you go # Bismillah, will not let you go Let me go # No, no, no, no, no, no, NO # - Noel, I've - # Mama Mia, let me go # Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me # For me # For me # As I was saying we should try and find an exit before the caves close. \n- Good idea, Father. \n- How long have you been in here? Two days now, Father. \nAt least, I think it's two days. \nWe've been having a great laugh! I erI just think that everyone would like to get out and get home. \nWho can screech the loudest? Let's have a screeching competition! I'll go first Gerry Fields, your go. \n- I'd rather not, Father. \n- Go on! - It's easy-peasy! - I really think we should get out. \nGod, maybe you're right. \nIf not, we might have to eat each other! Like in that film Alive, where they get in a plane crash and they have to eat all their friends. \nLook! Here's me eating Tony! Tony's going, \"No, get off me, I'm not dead yet!\" I'd be going, \"But I'm hungry, Tony. \n\" And Tony'd be, \"Oh, no, go away,\" wouldn't you, Tony? Here's Tony's parents when they hear that I've eaten Tony! \"Why did you eat Tony? He was our only son. \n\" Then, I'd be at the funeral. \nI'd be going, \"Better not show my\" Will you shut up, will you? Will you please shut up? Will you shut up, shut up, shut up? Well Well, I've never I've never Tony, I'm putting you on my list of enemies. \nThere You're in for it now, Tony. \nHa! Only joking! Look what I've written! Come on, someone else for the screeching competition. \nJanine Reilly, she'd love a go! Go on, it's easy! I wouldn't do that, Noel. \nSeriously, Noel. \nSo, it was me, Father Collis and Father Duggan, and you'd think that someone like Chris Evans wouldn't want to hang around with us. \nAnd you'd be right! He didn't want to hang around with us at all! Ted, I'm going mad. \nYes, Noel, are you not worried about being trapped under those rocks? Not at all! You're here to keep me company and the Youth Group will be back with help soon. \nThey said they'd find the tour guide, tell him what happened, and come right back. \nThat's four tickets to Paraguay. \nBut I liked The English Patient. \nMmm. \nVery confusing and far-fetched and very, very boring. \nIt was my kind of film. \nHmm. \nOh, oh. \nI like The Piano as well. \nDid you see Harvey k eitel running around in the nip! Did you see that, Ted? Ted? Ted? I hate leaving Noel but we can't help by just listening to him. \nAt least he'll be safe under those rocks. \nLet's just get out then worry about Noel. \nGod, where is this exit? Aah! Ted, my tank top has turned into some sort of woman's bra! What? It's after unravelling. \nOh, my God, Dougal! We can find our way back with this. \nYou must have snagged it. \nIf we use this, we can find our way out. \nThank God, Dougal! We'll be out in no time. \nShould you be winding it up? Shouldn't we follow it? What? What use will it be when you've finished winding it up? I don't believe it. \n(Ted's voice echoing) I don't believe itbelieve it Believe it I don't believe it (Echo continues ) (Screams ) Pub. \nDrink. \nDrink. \nDrink, drink, drink, drink. \nDon't do it, Father. \nI won't let you do it. \nI know it hurts but you'll thank me for Oh, thank God. \nThere's someone buried in the caves. \nHe's Ok but you should go quickly. \nPlease hurry. \nCome on, I want to go before they rescue him. \nCome on, Dougal, relax. \nThe food will be here in a minute. \n(Telephone rings ) Hello? - Is that Father Crilly? - Yes, this is him. \nWe've been looking for you all night. \nDo you know a Mrs Doyle? First name, Mrs (Fire bell rings ) . \n. \nDoyle? Er, do I know a Mrs (Plates smash) . \n. \nDoyle? Erm We do, Ted. \nYes, she's our housekeeper. \nCan you come to the police station? She's been in a spot of trouble. \nNow, Mrs Dineen, if there's a fine, I'll pay it. \n- No, no, no - Thank you, Father. \nFather Hackett! Dougal, there's no time to eat that. \nWe have to get Mrs Doyle and Mrs Dineen (Phone rings ) . \n. \nand Father Jack out of prison. \nCome on. \nI'm very, very sorry. \nYou wouldn't have a lasagne or a chicken curry or something? No. \nOk, I'll just have a bag of chips and a Fanta orange as well. \nThis is a police station. \nRightin that case, just the chicken satay and pilau rice. \nI hope you don't think this happens all the time. \nWe're not all criminals in the church. \nI hope this won't put you off Mass. \nI'm a Protestant, Father. \nReally? Ah It's a straight choice, Father - a 200 fine or a night in the cells. \nWell, I wouldn't have that kind of money on me. \nIn the circumstances, a night in the cells might be the better option. \n- Ted - Shut up, Dougal. \n- Ted. \n- Dougal, be quiet. \n- I was - All right, all right! Here. \nHere's your blood money! But let me say this, once, the police were friends of the Church. \nDrunk-driving charges quashed, parking tickets torn up. \nEven a blind eye to murder but now And you, are you satisfied? I gave him the money. \n\"Ted, give him the 200 you won. \n\" Well, I did. \nHappy? Once again, you've made me look an idiot in front of real people. \nThank you so much. \nRight, to be honest, Ted, I forgot you had the money. \nI was going to say your fly's open. \nGod, what did I say? There's always trouble on the mainland. \nI'm never going there again unless it's completely unavoidable. \nWhich, it isn't. \nUnfortunately. \n(Door bell) OhII don't believe it! # Fat bottomed girls they make the rocking world go round # "

      "Ted! How are ya? Ah, Dougal! Hello there. \nDid you have a good time? What? Great! Everything here's been fine. \nNothing wrong here at all. \nThere's no problems here at all. \nSo, how was the school reunion? (k eep talking. \n) Oh, ahem I was at the old school reunion (Where's this go? ) Father, do you think a cup of tea might calm you down? Father McGuire, you're back! Thank God! You've got to do something! Father Crilly's gone mad. \nIt's this football thing. \nGod Almighty, that time of the year again! Yes. \nAnd he thinks Father Byrne's trying to find out his tactics. \nIt's only a stupid game of football, for goodness' sake! Mrs Doyle, I'm sorry but no! There's nothing stupid about football. \nAnd nothing stupid about the annual All Priests 5-a-Side Over 75s' indoor football challenge match against Rugged Island. \nPlease, Father. \nDo something. \nOh! Anyway, Dougal, you were saying? About the school reunion? Well, I didn't recognise any of them. \nGuess what? They'd all become firemen. \nI was the only one who wasn't a fireman. \nHow's that? Dougal, eryou didn't go to a fire station by mistake? Ah Ted, come on. \nYou're going a bit mad. \nI don't know what you're talking about! There's nothing wrong with me, everything with me is fine. \nTed, I'm going to have to do something you won't like. \nCall it female intuition, or whatever the male equivalent is. \nBut this isn't going to go down well in the Ted camp. \nI think Sorry. \nYou were going a bit too mad. \nMy God, what have I done? Look at the room! You're right, Dougal, I have to get a hold of myself. \nTed, being bugged by Dick Byrne, that's not likely, is it? Come on, Ted. \nLook at you! You look terrible. \nI've been having trouble sleeping. \nI'm going to try this stuff, Dreamy Sleepy Nightie Snoozy Snooze. \nDreamy Sleepy Nightie Snoozy Snooze. \nYes. \nIt's a bran-based alcoholic chocolate sleeping aid. \nIt's banned in most European countries. \nThat means it's very good. \nI'll go and get us both an ice cream. \nThat'll calm us down. \nAh, that'd be nice. \nWhere are you going to get an ice cream? - There's a van outside. \n- Is there? It's not going to sell much ice cream there. \nThey're on to us, Cyril! Go, go, go, go (Tyres screeching) Come on, Father Cullen! Get your arse in gear! Father Whelan, you can move faster than that! Get into it! Missing the target from there, you need shooting! I'm very tired. \nI'm 85! God, that's a defeatist attitude, Father Cullen! I'm holding you back for extra training! You'll stay here until seven! Do 15 laps of the pitch! But Off you go I don't know! The attitude of those lads. \nThere was a time when the over 75's team putting their hearts into it kick the (BLEEP) ball! What's wrong with you?! All over the place. \nDick Byrne's lot have a new fella. \nHe's flip hot - an Italian! Oh, the Italians know about football. \nAnd the world of fashion. \nDo you remember that fella who was so good at fashion they had to shoot him? Where's Nick Doorley? Father Jack's not here, Nick's not Our main bloody strike force and they're not bloody here! You wouldn't think Father Jack could play football. \nNo, then you see him Beautiful player. \nPoetry in motion. \nDid you tell me once Jack had a trial with Liverpool? No, he was on trial in Liverpool. \nI wonder where Nick is. \nGod, yeah. \nJack's good but if anything happened to Nick we'd be up to our necks in flip. \nAnd with this new fella on Dick's team, we need Nick at the very peak of his powers. \nSo, there's no way he'll be able to play? No. \nNo, he's dead. \nIt's completely out of the question, then? Is it? Is it completely out of the question? Ted, you're clutching at straws. \nC'mon lads. \n(Ted) You're right. \n(Fax machine bleeps ) Ah, isn't that nice? \"Sorry to hear you died,\" from Father Heggaty in Chicago. \nDoes that coffin has a fax machine? Yes, it's the latest thing. \nLook at this This display tells you how long you've been buried and this one tells you how deep down the coffin is. \nIsn't it amazing? With these humidity controls, Father Nick won't start decaying tillsometime next year. \nNiall, you must stop buying this catalogue stuff. \nIt's a complete waste of money. \nI mean, look, a remote control wheelchair. \nWhy would you need that? You probably get more use from those fake joke arms. \nOh, those They seemed funny at the time. \nThey reminded me of my own arms. \nFake arms! Niall, honestly! What situation could ever need a radio-controlled wheelchair, or a pair of joke arms? Only, I would imagine, a completely ludicrous one. \nYes. \nDo you think you can win this match without Father Nick? I don't know. \nHe has a great partnership with Had, he had a great partnership with Father Jack up front. \nGod, if Dick Byrne wins We're using the forfeit system again. \nLast year when we lost Dick made me photocopy my own rear end. \n- (Phone ) - Excuse me. \nThey'll never let me back in that library again. \nHello? Oh, it's for you. \nHello? (Dick) 'I am going to win again, Ted!' Ha! That's what you think, Dick Byrne, but we've got some Wait a minute! How did you know I was here? (Dial tone, ice cream van jingle ) Damn you, Father Dick Byrne! Yeah, all right, all right. \nMore bad news, Dougal. \nOh, no, no, no I've just spoken to Father Ned Fitzmorris. \nHe tripped on a paving stone and one of his kneecaps fell off. \nThere's no way round it. \nI'm going to have to put him in goal. \nGod, Ted, I can't wait to get back into the old physio role again. \nRunning on to the pitch with the magic sponge and doing all physio-type things. \nDougal, do you know what the sponge does? Itsoaks up germs. \nDougal, I don't want you to take this the wrong way but I was thinking of a new role for you this year. \nRight Erm I'd like you to keep an eye on the corner flags, and make sure no one steals them. \nAh, thank God. \nI thought you were going to give me something completely stupid to do. \nBut, wow! Watching the corner flags! Big responsibility. \nFootball, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football! What you men see in it, I don't know. \nA load of men kicking a bit of leather around a field. \nYou men! The things you think are great fun! Like going to the films. \nMen sitting around looking at films. \nAnd roller coasters! A load of men going up and down on a metal track. \nAnd sailing! A load of men in a big boat floating around in the sea. \nAnd shouting! A load of men going around shouting! And so forth. \nWell, Mrs Doyle, there's more to football than you think. \nIn fact, I got you a book about it. \nAll right, Father, I'll give it a go. \nTed, Jack's been like that for a good long time. \nHe wouldn't be dead again, would he? Ah, no. \nHe's probably dreaming of his old sporting days. \nMore water. \nWell, today's the day. \n- Got the hang of it yet, Dougal? - It's harder than you think, Ted. \nThe trick is to try and keep your eye on it. \nArgh! Ah, hello, Ted. \nI waserjust eatingmy breakfast. \nDougal, that's a fib. \nWhat are you really doing? II've lost the flag, Ted. \nI just put it down for a second and the next thing it was gone. \nTed, you're going to have to give me an easier job. \nIt's too much, too soon. \nDougal. \nLook at Father Jack. \nWould he give up so easily? Look at that steely determination. \nThat air of defiance. \nThat I've just realised, Jack's been asleep for 14 days. \nOh, my God! He's drunk an entire bottle of Dreamy Sleepy Nighty Snoozy Snooze! (Dramatic music) Go on my son. \nWell, there he is, Ted. \nFather Romeo Sensini. \nLooks after himself. \nDrinks only very, very fine wine. \nCan climb two flights of stairs. \nNeeds only one nun to help him get out of a chair. \n- You haven't a chance. \n- That's what you think, Dick. \nFather Hackett's been through rigorous training. \n- He's never been fitter. \n- Ha! (Snoring) (Ted) Father! Father, please wake up! What are we going to do? I can't believe we're in this completely ludicroussituation. \nGod Almighty, Mrs Doyle, how could you find this type of thing interesting? That's what I thought. \nSit down. \nLook at this. \nOoh! Ready? Ready? (Whistle ) Close him down! Close him down! Ah, Mary, have you got me glasses? Sensini's got an open goal. \nIf we don't do something he's going to score in a matter of minutes. \nWhere did he come from? Get rid of it! Get rid of it! What? Turn around! Concentrate on the game! Is that Father Crilly? Hello, Fathe.\nSomeone's going to have to get tighter on the Italian. \nGo wide! Go wide! Argh! # You're not singing you're not singing # You're not singing any more! # You're not singing any more! # Penalty! Typical Italian. \n(Rapid heartbeats ) (Very slow heartbeat) He's sent the keeper the wrong way! Yes! Oh! Goal! Goal! Yes! (Dick) Yes! Yes! Goal! Listen! I know you're tired and have to be back in the home by eight. \nBut remember one thing You are carrying the whole of Craggy Island on your shoulders. \n- Metaphor! - It's my bac.\nJim, it's a metaphor, didn't mean it literally. \nDon't jump into the flow. \nNow, play the best game of what remains of your lives. \nI want you to rip Dick's team to shred.\nMetaphor again, Jim. \nNow, get out there and let's lick some arse! kick some arse! We're going to win, Cyril. \nI want a souvenir of this game. \nGo get me a corner flag. \nGo get me a corner flag. \nOh, yeah. \nYes. \nGood! Go on, Father Jack. \nGo! (Mrs Doyle ) Come on! (Crowd cheering) Hey! Oh. \nYou're shit! Ah! Open goal! Go on Father Cullen! What? Don't look at me! You've only the keeper to beat! Go on! Go on! Yes! Yes! Have I done something wrong? Whoo! Better luck next year, lads! You lost, Cyril. \nGoodbye, Dick. \nGoodbye, Cyril! Can they not stay and have a drink? No. \nDick has to go home and do his forfeit. \nThe forfeit! What is it? Dick He has to kiss Cyril on the cheek! Brilliant! Cyril won't have a clue what's going on! Dick'll hate having to kiss a man! He's notoriously homophobic! Ted, you should have this. \nYou deserve it. \nNo. \nI think we'd better head on home. \nAh, go on Ted, have a glass. \nWait a second! These are fake hands! - Got the forfeit, Ted! - Oh, God. \nDick said it was a special forfeit because you're such a cheating bastard! All right, open it! The tension's killing me. \nDon't worry. \nHe probably wants you to clean his car or some What is it? Break it to me gently! All right. \n\"Ted, by this time next week, you have to\" - What? - \"You have to\" \"kick Bishop Brennan up the arse!\""

      "Oh, come on now, lads. \nQuixiquoddal, the Volcano God is angry. \nWe must appease his wrath! Volcano God! What kind of nonsense is that? I'll ask you one more time, will you not give Catholicism a try? (Irish accent) It wouldn't catch on. \nWe don't agree with the Pope's line on contraception. \nIt's the '90s for God's sake! (Ted screaming) Cup of tea, Father? Father? Cup of tea? Father, what's the matter with you? You're a million miles away. \nHmm? Oh, sorry, Mrs Doyle. \nI was just thinking about my next parish. \nBishop Brennan is always threatening to send me somewhere unpleasant and this time I think he just might go through with it. \nYou see I'm going to kick him up the arse. \nOh, that! I don't think he'd mind that. \nI'd say he'd love a good, big, hard kick up the arse. \nTed! Clint Eastwood has been arrested for a crime he didn't Oh, wait, no, it's a film. \nDo you really have to kick him up the arse? I lost the bet, Dougal. \nI have to do my forfeit. \nDo you remember when Dick Byrne lost the darts tournament and he had to say \"Bollocks\" very loudly in front of Mary Robinson? He's not gonna let me away with this one. \nYou're right. \nThere's a code of honour involved. \nYou could lie to him. \nNo, he's insisted that you take a photograph as proof. \nOh, God, Dougal, what can I do? - I like this parish. \n- Do you?! Well, no. \nLook at it this way. \nBishop Brennan has only visited us twice in the last three years. \nHe hates us. \nHe thinks we're all eejits. \nEspecially you, Ted. \nHe thinks you're the biggest eejit of them all. \nHead honcho eejit number one! He may never come here again. \n(Phone ) Hello, Bishop Brennan. \nYes. \nOk. \n- He's coming tomorrow. \n- Oh, no. \nWhy? What I gather is that Father Dick Byrne has told Bishop Brennan of a miraculous image that's been appearing in the skirting boards of the house here. \nHe told Bishop Brennan that in the wood grain you can see what appears to be a perfect likeness ofBishop Brennan. \n- You found out all that just there? - Yes, he's very excited about it. \nImages appearing on skirting boards. \nThat's a bit wacky, isn't it? It's strange all right. \nIt's like the Turin Shroud or that woman in Sligo. \nPadre Pio keeps appearing in her teabags. \nOr the time I saw God's face in that painting. \nThat was strange. \nIt wasn't that strange, it was a painting of God. \nHave you heard about the mystery of the Mud Angel? - The mystery of the Mud Angel? - God, it's weird. \nEvery week in the mud outside O'Leary's pub, there's a perfect outline of a man - the Mud Angel. \nMystery solved. \nStill, visions and apparitions, it is a bit odd. \nIt's one of those areas of Catholicism that's frankly a bit mad. \nThe whole Catholic thing's a bit of a puzzler, isn't it? Careful, Dougal. \n- I'm a bit afraid of Len, though. \n- Join the club. \nI won't worry about it. \nThe worst thing is to keep thinking about it and become so anxious and obsessed that you can't sleep. \nThat's just Dougal? Dougal! Wh-What! What? God that was weird. \nWhat happened there? The last thing I remember is feeling very drowsy and tired then I can't remember anything at all after that. \nYes, Dougal. \nIt's called \"falling asleep\". \nYou do it every night. \nI don't know why you're finding it so easy to drop off. \nToday you're going to be taking a photograph of me kicking Bishop Brennan up the arse, and he won't like that. \nImagine someone taking a photo of you being kicked up the arse. \n- I wouldn't like that at all! - No, I thought you wouldn't. \nAnd his PA is coming, Father Jessup, the most sarcastic priest in Ireland. \n- When Len comes around - Hold it right there. \nDon't call Len \"Len,\" he's a bishop. \n- What are you not to call him? - Len. \nVery good. \nNow, just remember that. \nLen, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len, Len. \nOk, now let's get a good night's sleep. \nIt's morning. \nWe must have talked all night. \nAt least we have a few hours before (Alarm clock rings ) I set it early so we'll have plenty of time before (Doorbell) Mrs Doyle, stall him for a few seconds. \nCome on, Dougal. \nHello. \nThis is the housekeepe.\nYour Grace. \nIs that aa hat you're wearing? It's called a biretta. \n- Is it? - Yes! Well, that's enough stalling. \nIn you go. \n(Ted) That's very true, Dougal. \nYou see the importance of the Eucharist in the Mass from what St Paul says here. \nThe way I see it Pretending to talk about religion. \nCrilly! Ah! Hello, Len. \nDon't call me Len, you little prick! I'm a bishop! Oh, right. \nWell done. \nYou know, this type of thing 24 hours a day. \nCrilly, I'll make this short. \nShow me the likeness and I'll be off. \nI have to be off to Rome for an audience with the Pope. \nI love those programmes. \nHave you seen the one with Elton John? Shut up! Hello, Father Jessup. \nHelping Bishop Brennan, then? No, I'm up in space doing important work for NASA. \nNow, show me this thing. \nIt's very like you, Your Grace. \n- Oh, really? - You're better looking, of course. \nI don't mean that in an intimate way. \nEr Nasty day. \nDid you come by the new road? No, we went round by Southern Yemen. \nAnyway, before we look at the skirting board do you mind if Father McGuire takes a few photographs? Oh, this is nothing! Nothing. \nI, um, I suppose I suppose we better go. \nAh, now, this is a new one. \nB-B-Before we look at it, perhaps we should say a prayer. \nNo, I don't want All right, then. \nCarry on. \nOh, Lord, at this time of great joy for Bishop Brennan, when you have seen fit to put his face into the skirting board of our house, we ask you to consider the gift of forgiveness. \nYou, who are the most forgiving of all gods Of all gods? What other gods are there? Erfalse gods. \nOh, Lord, heap blessings upon wise Bishop Brennan, the best bishop in the world by miles. \nFor he endureth without spite, amen. \nThere it is, Your Grace, have a look, it's under the window. \nWell I don't see anything. \nWhat happened there? Crilly just jumped through the window. \nCrilly! Crilly, are you out there? What's going on? Why did he jump through the window? An Audience With Lily Savage, that was good as well. \n- The Pope, that'll be just great. \n- Why'd you jump through the window? I didn't jump through the window. \nYou did. \nYou jumped through the window. \nRight It was because of shock. \nI saw your face, did you not see it? - No, I did not. \n- Did you not? - Did you see it, Dougal? - No. \nGod, it was extraordinary. \nDo you not notice the holy smell in the room? That might be Jack's underpants hamper. \nI'll put it back in his room. \nLook, it's uncanny. \nI'm surprised you don't appear on more things. \nYou're such a top-of-the-range bishop. \nCrilly, it is just an indistinct squiggle. \nCome on, Jessup, we're leaving. \nCrilly, where is my cloak? Your Grace. \nFather Crilly, I've just heard on the news that they've taken the roads in. \n- They've taken the roads in? - Yes. \nWhen the rain is bad, they store them in a warehouse on the east of the island. \nWhat?! I have to be in Rome tomorrow for an audience with the holy father! Don't worry, Len, they repeat the shows all the time. \nThey'll have the roads back out by tomorrow. \nSo we have to spend the night? Yes. \nOh, bollocks. \nWill I make up the beds in the spare room? No, we'll sleep outside in a ditch. \nOk, so. \n- Would you like a cup of tea? - No, we'd rather die of thirst. \nOk, so. \nMrs Doyle, I think Father Jessup was being a bit, er, sarcastic. \nWhat? Were you being sarcastic, Father Jessup? No, we want to die of thirst. \nI know it's confusing but just do the opposite of what Father Jessup says. \nOk. \nSoyou really do want a cup of tea? Yes. \n(Snorting, muttering) Ah, the kraken awakes. \nDid we disturb you, Father Hackett? Arse! Biscuits! What?! How dare you speak to His Grace like that. \nApologise immediately! (High-pitched voice ) I'm so, so, sorry. \nNow, that's sarcasm. \nDougal, there's no way I'll be able to kick Bishop Brennan up the arse. \nHe's just too scary. \nI'd rather take my chances in another parish. \nOh, my God. \nI might have a way you can kick him up the arse and get away with it. \nIf you did, that would make you the most intelligent person in the world. \n- Do you think that's likely? - I wouldn't go that far! I'm no Jeffrey Archer, I don't care what anyone says. \nWhy don't you just kick him up the arse and act like nothing happened? Brilliant, Dougal(!) No, Ted, seriously. \nLook, how scared are you of Len? Very scared. \nExactly. \nSo how likely would it be for you to kick him up the arse? - Wellnot likely at all. \n- Exactly! So when you kick him up the arse, carry on like nothing happened. \nHe'd never believe that you'd be brave enough to kick him up the arse. \nHe'd think he'd just imagined it. \nMy God! That That might work. \nThat might well work. \nI'm gonna do it! I'm ready! As God is my witness, I will kick Bishop Brennan up the arse! (Bishop ) Crilly! k eep the noise down in there! It's worth just taking one more look. \nThis has been a complete waste of my time. \n- Well, things might pick up. \n- All right, let's see. \nCome on. \nWait. \nThat's not yours, it belongs Don't you look at me like that! Give that back or there'll be trouble. \nCome back here. \nGive it Oh, help! (Screaming) What was that? Mice or something. \n- Can you see anything? - No, I can't. \nOh, wait a minute. \nThere seems to bea very crude water colour painting of a man in a bishop's hat. \nReally? Let me see. \nAh, you're right! Tell you what must have happened, Dougal probably didn't want you to be disappointed so he must have drawn that himself. \nAh, he meant well. \nAnyway, I'm sure you want to be off, catch that ferry, huh? We'll order you a taxi. \nSo, off to see the Pope? I bet you're looking forward to that. \n- Did you see anything? - No, nothing there at all, sadly. \nIt was a wild goose chase. \nWhere's Father Jessup? - Maybe he went on ahead. \n- Ok, so. \nSee you soon, Your Grace. \nCome back as soon as you can. \n(Car horn honks ) (Both) Bye! (Taxi driver) Your Grace? Your Grace, are you all right? You were right! He didn't notice a thing. \nYou gave him a really hard kick up the arse and he didn't realise it at all! Maybe Maybe I didn't kick him up the arse? No, Ted, I took the photograph, remember? Ha! You're right. \nI did do it! And I really went for it. \nMore sparkling wine? I need more sparkling wine! Did you pack this bag yourself, Your Grace? - Your Grace? - Uh - Fathe.\n- Arse. \nHelphelp. \nPlea Oh, thank God. \nHelp me. \nFather Jessup, what are you doing in Father Hackett's underpants hamper? He locked me in here. \nDear Godthe smell. \nAre you not terribly uncomfortable in there? Of course I'm uncomfortable! I want to get out. \nFair enough, so! Where are going?! Help me! Have you finished your meal, Your Grace? - Your Grace? - Uh - Have you finished your meal? - No. \n(Drunkenly) And this This is what I did First thing in the morning, I want 200 copies for all my friends. \nAnd one for myself blown up, ten-by-ten. \nYou feckin' old (Mumbling) Feck off! And from Ireland, Bishop Leonard Brennan. \nHe did kick me up the arse. \nArgh! Get me on the first plane back to Ireland. \nNow, goddamit! What are ye looking at, huh? Ahh Oh, Jesus Oh, God (Car approaching, horn honking) (Screaming) Oh, no! (Growling) Crilly! (Pounding on door) Crilly! Crilly! Crilly! I know you're under the bed. \nI can see you. \nAh, Bishop Brennan, hello! God Almighty, what brings you back? Come out from there now. \nNo. \nNo? I will give you ten seconds, Crilly. \n(Whimpering) It's just that I can see another vision of you, Your Grace. \nThe bits of fluff are arranging themselves into a bishop formation. \nOh! H-Hello! Great to see you back. \nWhat brings you here? Well, I suppose the company, the fresh air, the view from my window of that great pile of sludge but number one on the list is the matter of you kicking me up the arse. \nYes, I think that is the one I would prioritise. \n(Growling) Wh kicking What? What did I kick? I mean Don't try my patience, Crilly! You kicked me up the arse! Try to deny it and I will have you fed to the dogs! Wh Why would I do that? You'd kill me. \nYou're damn right I would. \nI would never ever kick you up the arse. \nYou're I think you're great. \nWell, I Huh? Are you sure you're not making aterrible mistake? - Do you think that's possible? - Of course it's not! Well, it did occur to me that it was a bit unbelievable. \nYe It's unbelievable because it didn't actually happen. \nI swear to you on all that I hold dear - on my life, on my religion, on God, on all the saints and angels in heaven I did not kick you up the arse. \nWell, you know, maybe Maybe I need a holiday. \nMaybe I have been sort of imagining things. \nYou have been imagining things. \nHave a holiday. \n- Shut up, Crilly! - Okey-dokey. \nBye, Bishop Brennan. \nDon't worry about the door. \nBye. \nCome back soon. \nTed, I got those copies. \nShut up, Dougal. \nShut up! The one you wanted blown up, where do you want that? What do you mean? Bye, Bishop Brennan. \nWe love you! Come here, Ted. \nTurn around. \nArghh! (Father Jessup ) I'm really enjoying this."

Dougal, there's nothing on. \nWhy don't you read a book? Oh, right. \nNo, Dougal. \nRead a different book. \nActually, it's been a few minutes. \nI'll see if there's anything good on now. \nHonestly, Dougal, you've got to broaden your mind. \nWhat are you reading, anyway? Well, I'm re-reading it. \nWilliam Shatner, Tek Wars. \nOh, no! This eejit! # My lovely Mayo Mammy # So gentle and so wise # Rocking on your rocking chair, baking cakes and pies # My lovely Mayo Mammy # My lovely, lovely Mayo Mam It's Eoin! Father, isn't he lovely? He's a brilliant dancer as well. \nUgh! Now, it's time to announce the winner of my fabulous poetry competition. \nYou wrote a poem about me, and the prize is that I come to the winner's house for a cup of tea. \nGod! Can you imagine that! Oh, God! So, over I go to my poetry corner. \nOk, here it is. \nThis week's winner. \n\"Eoin McLove is his name, \"Singing songs is his game, \"Someday, I will say hello, and for a cup of tea, we will go. \n\" (All) Aw! And the winner is Mrs O'Neill from kildare. \nAnd it says here, she's 110 years old! (All) Ooh! She also asks me what my favourite things in the world are. \nI'd have to say Well, jumpers and cakes. \nOh, no! What's this? It's a little puppy with a broken paw. \n(All) Aw! I'd better go home and nurse it back to health. \nGoodbye, everybody. \n(All) Bye! Hard luck, Mrs Doyle! Maybe next time. \nThere's one of his songs reminds me of the time my husband I've said too much. \nI'll just go listen to his latest album. \nHe's brilliant! Ha, women! Where? No, I mean \"Women!\" Oh, right, yeah. \n\"Women!\" - Tscha! - Tscha! Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em! Yeah! But there definitely aren't any women in here? No, you're fine. \nDo you know what? I could write a poem for that show. \nBe honest, the poetry Mrs Doyle writes will is bound to be hopeless! What would you write about? Ah, Dougal, inspiration can come from so many places. \nArgh! No, no, Father Nolan was in the gas explosion. \nPunched a hole in his chest the size of a football! They identified him with dental records! - Poor Father Nolan! - Yes, he's very low at the moment. \n(Gasps ) (Gibbering) Oh, my God! Eoin Island! Calm down, what was that again? To Craggy Island Read out my poem! Your poem? Well, I wrote it as a surprise. \nIt was my poem. \nNo, no! It's mine! I'm sorry, Mrs Doyle, I don't think so. \nWhat's the first line? \"Eoin McLove has a happy face. \n\" That's not my poem! No, it's mine! Ha ha ha ha! I'm hugely confused, Ted. \nThe only thing I can think of that must have happened is that Mrs Doyle's poem was better than yours. \nBut that couldn't be, could it? That your poem was actually worse than Mrs Doyle's? That just couldn't happen, could it? Could it? - When's he coming? - Argh! - Tell us! - I can't. \nIt's a secret. \nThursday? Friday? Saturday? Sunday? Aha! I don't want anybody to know. \nYou won't tell anyone, will you? I swear I won't. \nMay I get struck down by every disease that it is known for a middle-aged woman to suffer from. \nAnd as you and I know, that's a lot of diseases. \n(Muffled gossip ) (Screams ) I think he's here, Ted. \nThe good news is, he can only afford a crappy blue Cortina. \n- Imagine going around in that thing! - That's my car! Oh, right. \nStill, you know what I mean. \nMrs Doyle, he's here! Is this the place? What is it? A mental hospital? No, it's a parochial house. \nThe winner is the priests' housekeeper. \n- Better prepare the ground. \n- So do I have to walk to the door? - Yes. \n- I have to walk to the door meself? Yes, you have to walk to the door yourself. \nMr McLove will not allow any photographs apart from one official picture for advertising purposes or sign autographs in ink. \nMr McLove is not an equal opportunities employer. \n(Mobile phone ) - Hello? - 'Hello. \nIs Patsy there?' Yes, Eoin, this is Patsy. \nI'm in the hall. \nWill you let me in or will I knock on the door or what? Dougal, he's our guest. \n- Let's do this for Mrs Doyle. \n- Yeah, I know! I'm Eoin McLove, that's who I am. \n- Hello, you're very welcome. \n- I'll leave you, then. \n- I'll talk to these two. \n- Yes. \nWhat if the old one speaks and I don't know what to say back? I don't know! And the thick-looking one? He's weird. \nEoin! I smell wee. \nWhere's that from? It's this one here. \nThis one smells of wee. \n(Growling) Best step away there. \nSo where's the winner so I can go home for my tea? Actually, you can have your tea here. \nMrs Doyle! Hello. \nBrilliant, she fell on her arse! (Spooky music) Right. \nThat's your 20 minutes up. \nI'm off. \nDon't try to stop me. \nEoin, did you enjoy your tea? What? Don't know. \nYeah Whatever. \nI want to go. \nIt's getting dark. \nAre you afraid of the dark? It's only because the sun goes There's this It's got something to do with clouds! I want to get out. \nHow do you get out? Eoin, was there another poem that was very good this week? No. \nAre you sure? The only other one was from this lunatic. \nWe called the police because it was so demented. \nNo, that couldn't be it. \nI'll stop talking because I don't know what to say. \nHello, is Patsy there? Don't talk to me on the mobile, I'm right beside you. \nWhat? This is a very bad line. \nPatsy? Oh, no! Not again. \n(Old ladies ) Eoin! Eoin! Ladies Go on home now. \nNothing to see here. \nGo away, you dirty old biddies. \nEoin! I'm afraid we can't stay and chat. \nI have a baptism tomorrow. \nThe baby has a very big head It's like a big tide of jam coming at us but jam made out of old women. \nI've got a bad feeing about this. \nLet's get back in the house. \nGo away! I don't want to catch the menopause! Let me in! Let me in! (Screaming) Oh, God, that was close. \n- Dougal! - Hello! - I don't mean hello, I mean help! - Oh, right. \nAah! Actually, Dougal, that's my hand. \nTry hitting the women's hands. \nOk, yes. \nSorry, Ted. \n(Patsy ) Hello? Hello? The battery's dead. \nWhat about your phone? They've cut the lines. \nThey lie in wait like wolves. \nThe smell of blood in their nostrils. \nWaiting. \nInterminably waiting. \nAnd then He's right, Ted. \n- What do they want? - They just want to mother him. \nHe's got nobody to blame but himself. \nWhen you've got album covers like this, you're just asking for trouble. \nI'm no good at judging the size of crowds, but I'd say there's about 17 million out there. \nI'm hungry. \nWhere's the jam? You're not supposed to eat before your dinner. \nYou shut up. \nI'm Eoin McLove. \nI can do what I like. \nI've got a terrible secret. \n- Do you? - Yeah. \n- What? - Not telling. \nEoin! - What? - Don't eat the jam from the jar. \nLeave me alone! I can have you killed. \nGet out! II was just cleaning the spoon. \nI can't stand it. \n- Why are they so quiet? - (Ted) Patsy! What do you want? What do you want?! Argh! It's all right. \nShe's one of us. \nWhat? What? Yesyes. \nEoin, Mrs Doyle wants to know, would you like a cake? Who? - Mrs Doyle. \nThis woman here. \n- Oh, right. \n(Whispering) It's banana. \nShe knows it's your favourite. \nGod! I love that. \nI'll eat that. \nNo one else is getting any. \nThis is all for me. \nWhat's going on? (Whispering and laughter) - Oh, my God. \n- What's happening? I'm scared. \nI don't know how to tell you this but Mrs Doyle, in an unusual move, has baked a jumper in the cake. \nI'm going to get sick. \nThis is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. \nI'm not wearing a cake jumper! This is horrible. \nYuk! (Sobs ) I'll eat the cake, though. \nWe have to get him out of here. \nYou know what we need? Something to lead them away from him, so he can escape. \nSome kind of misleading event but what could it be? I know! A diversion. \nThat's what it's called, a diversion. \nI know what it's called. \nI didn't ask what it's called. \nI want to know what the diversion should be. \nCome on, come on, ideas, ideas. \n(Rattling) (Muttering) Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls! Yes. \nThank you, Father Jack. \nI think we need more concrete ideas than that. \nWhat do old women like? Do you know what they really love? A big game of bingo! Let's lure them into some kind of giant bingo game! Right. \nHow would we do that? We could print some bingo cards on our printing press, then Oh. \nYes, it's the lack of a printing press that lets us down there. \nOr bingo balls, or a microphone or any bingo paraphernalia at all. \nDamn! So near and yet so far. \n(Banging on window ) What? No! No way! Go on home! Shoo! Oh, Father, we just wanted to tell you that was a brilliant Mass you did last Sunday. \nOh, well, thank you. \nI was very happy with the sermon, actuall.\nOh, yes. \nHow did it start again? Let's see \"I think it was the actor Nick Berry who said\" Sorry, Father, we can't hear you very well through the window. \nRight. \n\"I think it was the actor Nick Berry who said\" Oh! There he is! He's asleep! Isn't he lovely! Aah! You're not interested in my sermon! Why is the window open? I can't hold them back! Get upstairs! (Old ladies ) Eoin! Eoin! Eoin! Eoin! Eoin! Back! God! What are we gonna do now? (Chanting) Eoin, Eoin What are we going to do? I'm not so worried for ourselves, but the little ones. \nThey have their whole lives ahead of them. \nEoin, Eoin (Cock crows ) Stop! Stop! Ladies! It's after seven o'clock. \nI think your husbands might be wondering where their breakfasts are. \nMrs Doyle's right. \nRemember last year, Mrs Dunne? Your husband tried to wash a cup and burnt the house down. \nAnd Mrs Collins, when Mr Collins tried to make the bed on his own and lost a leg. \nSurely you can't let them get through a day on their own? Go on home. \n(Spooky music) Hup! Hup! (All sigh) Can I have this duck? Right, we're off. \nDid you have those cases when you came? No. \nThey're yours. \nI just liked a lot of stuff here, so I thought I'd take it off with me. \nOh! That's very cheeky. \nWell, I'm taking everything. \nCome on, Patsy. \nI'm sorry he's been so much trouble. \nI think it has to do with his problem. \nOh, you mentioned that earlier. \nWhat is it? I have no willy. \nRight. \nDon't you have something to say to Mrs Doyle? Er Thanks for the cake jumper. \nThere's bloody cake bits all over the place. \nFather, you've been so kind. \nWould you like to come up to the show? Father McGuire said you're always trying to get on TV. \nNo, no That's not true. \nIt is true. \nYou're always trying to get on television! You said it's your number one ambition. \nDid I? I might have said that. \nJoking, probably. \nAnyway, I actually couldn't be bothered. \nThere's a new part in the show - we get an audience member to do a quiz. \n- There's a cash prize. \n- I'll do it. \nFather, you've got four out of five right on your specialist subject, William Shatner's Tek Wars. \nSo, if you get the general knowledge question right, the 500 will be yours! (Audience ) Oooh! Oh, no! People will think this is rigged. \nJohn Paul II. \nWhat was his name before he became Pope? Jim?"

It's pointless! What did I become a priest for anyway? What an utterly useless waste of time. \nI'd have been of more use sweeping roads. \nListen to him! It's fabulous being a priest! Think of the comfort you bring to the sick! They can't get enough of it! And what about your friends? Father Alan, for instance! I've never met him before. \nAll right. \nAnyone know him?

Yes, stay away from war and death and that whole Mirror pension fund area. \nAll right. \nI'll stick to things like puppies and cushions. \nPuppies and cushions. \nI'm in a better mood already. \nFather, that sermon today Frankly, it bored the arse off me. \nWell, Eugene, I'm not here to entertain you. \nIf you want that type of thing, go and see Jean-Michel Jarre. \nWhat the hell was it about anyway? - Well, it was - Ah, Jesus! What was my sermon about, Dougal? Do you remember? Sorry, Ted. \nI was concentrating too hard on looking holy. \nTo be honest, I couldn't give a toss. \nThis is much more fun than killing yourself, isn't it, Kevin? - Suppose. \n- Come on, Kevin, cheer up. \nThat's me and Dougal's job now. \nWe're in the Smile Brigade. \nNot the fire brigade, the Smile Brigade! We're going to keep you happy and cheery until you can go to the bank. \n- Go to the bank? - Go home. \nI meant go home. \n- I'll have your money on Monday. \n- It was a slip of the tongue. \nI don't even remember how much it was. \n- It was a tenner. \n- Twenty! Twenty. \nI'm sorry, but let's nip that in the bud now. \nIt was twenty. \nI'm sorry, but it was twenty. \nAnyway, you're gonna stay here until you cheer up. \nThings are gonna happen for you now, I can feel it. \nOh, nice move, k ev. \nActually, Kevin you've landed on a snake there. \nYou have to go, er, go down. \nWhat's wrong with you?

A visitor, Father. \nFather Crilly, hell.\nHello. \nMy name is Father Buzz Cagney. \nI was at the conference. \nI was hoping we could have a chat. \nI think you might be interested in a little proposition. \nThen I was in Utah. \nNot a good Catholic market. \nMormon country. \nOut there a guy can have five, ten wives. \nThat's a lot of action. \nAction, yeah Hard to compete with that. \nThen I was in Reno Reno? Isn't that very like Wicklow? I did a Mass in Wicklow once. \nVery rough crowd. \nYou have to do a good sermon or they'll hop all over you. \n- Where are you now? - I'm in Beverly Hills. \nBruberly Huls? Oh, wow! Good God. \nYou really landed on your feet there. \nTell me, is it really as false and artificial as everyone says it is? Yes. \nI'd love that. \n- You do meet a lot of celebrities. \n- Yeah? Like who? - Kevin Spacey, he's nice. \n- Don't know him. \nWhat about Val kilmer? I believe he's a complete bastard. \nDid you ever think of going out there yourself? I usually go on holidays with my curate. \nHe can't take the sun too well. \nWho are you? What are you talking about? This is Father Buzz Cagney. \nHe's just on a short visit. \n- He's from America. \n- America? We were just talking about that kurt Cobain. \nHe was from America. \nImagine blowing your head off with a shotgun! God, how did he manage to survive that?! Erhe didn't. \nHe died. \nOh, right. \nYou go to bed. \nI'll be up in a minute. \nAll right. \nGood night, lads! You'll be up in a minute? Yes, we sleep together. \nAnyway, who else do you know? Hello! Father, are you looking forward to your lunch tomorrow? Well Yes, I suppose so. \nI think you'll enjoy it. \nYou do like pheasant, don't you? Pheasant? God, I love pheasant! Well, that's a little clue. \nThe thing you'll be eating likes pheasant as well! Mrs Doyle, you're not going to cut his nails now, are you? I have to, Father. \nHe's been worrying the armrests again. \nOh, all right. \nBuzz, just slip this on. \nAnyway, you were saying? Yeah, I was curious, how much money did this parish bring in last year? How much money? God, I don't know. \n(Smash) Another bloody window gone. \nI suppose we take in about 150. \nMaybe 200. \nOw! Mrs Doyle! Aim into the wall, please. \n200, huh? What's that? Not even $400. \nYou know what I'd do with $400? I'd wipe my ass with $400. \nGood God. \nCan that still be used as legal tender? My parish, St John's, made $2 million last year. \nThat's a lot of sherry and steak dinners. \nMrs Doyle! Seriously, now, do it later! Oh, all right, Father. \nThis is the St John's brochure. \nIt's a little out of date. \nWe've had another swimming pool built and these ladies serving drinks would be in their 20s now. \nWow. \nCool. \nTed, the other day, I saw how you dealt with that suicide guy. \nI have to say, I liked what I saw. \nHow'd you like to work with me in LA, in a satellite parish to St John's? You meanLA? That's un . \n. \nbelievable! That's fantastic! Could you swing it? It's a good parish. \nIf you work hard, the rewards are there. \nYeah, spiritual rewards. \nNo. \nReal rewards. \nReally? It's a land of opportunity. \nYou want something, you can get it. \nI want it! Really? It's official? ! Yes! Yes, great news! Thank you, Buzz. \nThank you! Yes! One step at a time. \nGot to get them all together. \nFather Jack, Dougal, Mrs Doyle I'm going to America! Yes! Ted, could I talk to you for a minute? Sure. \nI, er I just wanna thank you for talking me off the ledge. \nIt was very good of you. \nI can't pretend that I'm any happier, I'm afraid. \nThe world still seems a dark, unpleasant place Yes! I have to get my stuff over. \nBut that won't be a problem. \nKevin! Hello! What can I do for you? Well, it's just I feel as if I should tell someone where my thoughts have been leading me these past weeks. \nDown some very dark and disturbing alleys. \nI think I'm experiencing what you might know as the dark night of the soul. \nHold on a second, Kevin. \nDo you mind if I put on some music? No, er I've begun to be plagued by doubts. \nDoubts about Oh, God, I mean, what if none of it's true? ( # Theme from Shaft) # Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine with all the chicks? # Shaft! # - Sorry, Father? - This is such a good song! I just keep thinking about the awful things that happen to people. \nWar, famine, that whole Mirror pension fund thing It just makes me despair. \n# Shaft! # I love this bit - # Daga daga daga daga # I doI do like this song, actually. \nAh, yes, it's terrific. \nMrs Doyle got it in a car-boot sale. \n(Both) # Shaft! Shaft! Shaft! You were saying, Kevin? It doesn't matter. \nI'd better go home anyway. \nThanks, Ted. \nListen, did you want that twenty? - Yeah Actually, keep it. \n- Really? All right. \nThanks, Ted. \nNo problem! Yes! Dougal, great news. \nI've been asked to go and work in America! Really? As what? Well, as a priest. \nA priest? Great. \nThat's more or less the same as what you do here. \n- Yes. \n- God, America! Fantastic! - When are we going? - When are we? What? I am going, aren't I? You wouldn't You wouldn't leave me behind, would you? Mrs Doyle! Ted's been offered a job in America and we're going with him! (Gasping) We're going to? We're geeng to Meerica? We're geeng to Meeca? Are we? Are we really? Are we really, Father? - Yes, we're going to America. \n- Tell Father Jack! Father Jack? (Easy listening) # I'll be seeing you # In apple blossom time # I'll be seeing you # To change your name to mine # Actually, I think I'd better just go and have a bit of a lie-down. \nFather, do you mind if I turn on the radio? No, I don't. \nPut it on. \n(DJ) '. \n. \nwith their new single, here's Radiohead. \n' # Wake from your sleep # The drying of # Your tears # Today # We escape # We escape # Woo-hoo! You guys! What a great Mass! - What d'you think, Buzz? - Seeing you today, Ted I haven't been this excited about religion in 30 years. \nYou know how to work the room! You inspired me. \nIt was one of those Masses when everything went right. \nI was just in the zone. \nThey're gonna love you in the States. \nYou put on a show. \nBut it's a competitive market. \nYou'll be up against Billy Graham and those Nation of Islam guys. \nYou gotta grab your audience. \nYou know where? - Yeah! By the balls! - I was gonna say by the shoulders. \nOh, right. \nSorry. \nYeah, it's fantastic! I feel like doing another Mass right away. \nPace yourself. \nI wouldn't do another Mass for a week. \nThe way I feel now, I could convert gays! Oh-ho, Ted. \nOne week to go! Yes, Dougal. \nUm Mrs Doyle, Dougal, Father Jack I have to tell you something. \nI have to be absolutely honest with you. \n- The money was just - Resting in the account. \nWe know. \nNo, it's nothing to do with that. \nWellthe thing is You won'tyou won't be able to come with me. \nWhen I go into space. \nI'm going to be the first priest in space! Yes. \nNASA have selected me to be the first priest in space - I thought you'd want to hear. \n- Great. \nThat's all right. \nGod, Ted! First America, then space! What's next? Who knows? As long as we can all go to America, that's the important thing. \nI think if I heard that I couldn't go for any reason, I'd have to say that would be the single most crushing blow of my life. \nA disappointment like that, I couldn't live with it. \nI might have to take the ultimate step and take my own life. \nMrs Doyle, that's a terrible thing to say! But it doesn't matter anyway because I am going to America! Yes. \nHa, ha. \nWell, Father, today's the day. \nI arranged for the electricity and phone to be cut off, and someone is going to take away the furniture and burn it! Well, come on, now, Father! We don't want to miss our plane! God, I've just seen my passport photo. \nI look hilarious. \nHere. \nGod, I've changed a lot. \nLook at Father Jack. \nHe's so excited he can barely keep still. \nSeriously, I have to say something. \nOh, I can't wait to hear this! Every time Ted talks to us these days it's more and more good news. \nNow you're going to tell us you're Santa! No, I'm not. \nIn fact, I'm the opposite to Santa. \nThe Antisanta? I'm afraid this is going to come as a terrible blow but I can't put it off any longer. \n- What are those guys doing here? - They just came to say goodbye. \nThey don't think they're coming, do they? No, I made that very clear. \nI told them a million times. \nJust say your goodbyes and get checked in. \nThen we'll go talk about your new parish. \nAll my life I've dreamed about something special happening to me. \nI think this is the greatest moment of my life. \nMe too. \nBig bras! Dougal, Mrs Doyle, Father Jack Why don't you wait in the caf? I'll check us in. \nWhich caf? The one that isn't a tourist office. \nOk, so. \nFlip. \nThey're never going to serve us. \n- (Chuckling) So, you all set? - I am. \nDamn! I forgot to pack my swimming trunks. \nWhat for? Well, I don't want to go au naturel at the pool. \nSee, I've I've a bit of downy fluff around that bottom area. \nOh, yeah, I heard about that. \nNo, I meant what pool? You don't have a pool. \nNo? Ok. \n- You'll have a basketball court. \n- Great. \nThat'll keep me fit. \nThe parish has tried to cool tensions between the gangs through sports. \nStop you there a moment, Buzz. \nDid you say 'gangs'? What does that mean? Well, LA's gang problem is getting better now. \nLast year there were only There's that word 'gangs' I asked you about. \nAlso, I noticed that it was followed closely by the word 'deaths'. \nYes. \nThe good news is that drive-by shootings are down. \nThere I note the word 'shootings'. \nBuzz? - Yes? - I quit! I didn't know I was going to America to umpire drive-by shooting tournaments. \n- Stop the plane! - It hasn't started yet, Ted. \nDon't start the plane! I'm getting off! Ted, is that you? Yes, it's me. \nListen Dougal, I've been thinking about things and I think it would be better if I didn't go to America. \nI think we'd all be happiest where we belong, on Craggy Island. \nFair enough, Ted. \nI didn't really want to go anyway. \nOh, Father, you're back. \nWhat's going on? Ted decided it would be better if we didn't go. \nReally? He's probably right. \nFeck! Come on, we'll go home and get you a drink. \n- Drink! - I thought you really wanted to go. \nYes, I thought I'd be a bit more disappointed, but now I realise I didn't want to go anyway. \nBesides, I don't think I can go. \nI haven't told my sister about it. \nCome on, Ted. \nLet's go. \nAh, yeah, you're here to stay, with me, Mrs Doyle and Father Jack, for ever and ever and ever and ever and ever - Down with this sort of thing. \n- Careful now. \n- Night, Dougal. \n- Night, Ted."
